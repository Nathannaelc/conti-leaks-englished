In fact, it is easier than with sphere and proxmox, go to virtualization management, look where the machines are (Balls, AD) and compare with the list that was removed, if the entire infrastructure on virtuals, then simply turn off all the machines in the manager, then in the Administrators panel in the roles turn off the Hipster-in service and locate the server with all the virtualization beacons (if there are no separate hardware (external) snapshots (better to elbow the snapshots and not delete them, unlike the VFMS file system, if you just delete the snapshot it can then restore via utilities like get data back or easy recovery).
