There is a separate VPS with Kali on board.
We use the following tool
It is rolled out as follows (Applied for KALI, for other OS you need to install additional software)

Cite

    gem install aquatone


Use it this way:
Cite

    aquatone-discover --domain example.com

or
Cite

    aquatone-discover -d example.com


In the output we get to the folder
Code: [Highlight]

/aquatone/examples.com/hosts.txt


Pinging hosts from the LAN for backdoors (See Exchange webshell tutorial)
