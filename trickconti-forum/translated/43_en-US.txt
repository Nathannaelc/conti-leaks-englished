It's hard to pick up the session

Anchor DLL is not creeping.
LSASS dump doesn't help (output is empty)

Deleted via GUI + reboot

Work is as follows - we drag the data via RDP (fiezilla/rclone/mega/etc), then an hour before locking on several servers remove cilance and they use the locker EXE piece and on other machines include a batch that turns off all the database services and their lock through a network. Profit.

If Cylance is not torn down, create a virtual machine on vSphere/Hyper-V/VmWare, join it to the domain, authenticate from YES and locate...

It may also work to connect your VPN in VPN BUT speeds on VPNs are usually very small (I do not recommend it)
