1) Find a server with free space >500gb (depending on number of boxes in the network)
2) Create a new folder there for .pst files
3) Share it with the Exchange Trusted Subsystem user
4) Grant Read/Write permissions to that user
5) Go to the IP address behind the Exchange server and start the Exchange management shell as Administrator
6) Next the same command: foreach ($mbx in (Get-Mailbox)){New-MailboxExportRequest -mailbox $mbx.alias -FilePath "\\\Server\SharedFolder\$($mbx.alias).pst"}
