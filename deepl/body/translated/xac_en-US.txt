Now he's off, I tried to look through the logs to find something - a lot of errors, I need to finish dero to rule out that the pool has a password in a different encoding
Now a lot of problems with it.
Maybe he also has an example of a bot
Which didn't make it.

[19:45:47] <rozteka> 1. sorting by "freshness
[19:45:56] <Stern> in botlist?
[19:45:59] <rozteka> 2. remove the fucking duplicate 100500 pieces from the same ipac
[19:46:00] <rozteka> I fucking just
[19:46:01] <rozteka> yeah
[19:46:05] <rozteka> it's 10 minutes later you're sitting there
[19:46:10] <rozteka> fuck you up with the bullshit information

 do it

[19:46:20] <rozteka> normal bots 90%+ always 1 machine from 1 network
[19:46:42] <rozteka> I already wrote it in the confab, but I think they won't do it without somebody higher
[19:46:50] <rozteka> just watch
[19:46:52] <Stern> yeah, no problem, let's do it fast
[19:46:52] <rozteka> I open botlist
[19:46:58] <rozteka> I want to get such a bot
[19:47:05] <rozteka> it shows me 250 bots online
[19:47:07] <rozteka> well, you think - okay
[19:47:16] <rozteka> in fact it's 50
and 200 thousands from the same networks
[19:47:28] <rozteka> and those 50 - you drive them around. isn't it crazy?
[19:47:34] <Stern> yeah
[19:47:43] <Stern> we'll think of something then
[19:47:44] <rozteka> and if you tick the checkbox to show 1 bot from 1 machine
[19:47:55] <Stern> separate ip just draw in other place
[19:47:55] <rozteka> + sorting by "freshness" . I would have no problem to go there once or twice a day

There's another guy who's got a lot of ADP access, but he wants a lot of money... I say let's get it for 2 hours without AP... Initially he charged 50, says he works this way with several affiliates...



[22:18:47] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> what types of access do you work with? forti vpn, rdp, citrix, cisco?
[22:18:48] <traffz007> i'm a direct project helpdesk, not an intermediary or anyone else, if you're there in the subject and you know our boss can make sure
[22:18:53] <traffz007> yes all take
[22:19:12] <traffz007> you can in the form of bots, you can in the form of access, rdp, no problem
[22:19:15] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> don't know, but certainly for the locker conti heard)
[22:19:19] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> forti vpn familiar too?
[22:19:21] <traffz007> if there is no AD it's not a problem, we'll get it in a couple of hours
[22:19:25] <traffz007> yeah sure
[22:26:05] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> discussed with his, for 35% agree, if there is no AD then agree for 15%, but such we have very rare, if you agree from you person / people who are often online, yes to throw a mate to work and panel)
[22:26:38] <traffz007> let's take without Hell then, 35 chief will not give
[22:26:50] <traffz007> 25 usually, there we give 30 to the most expensive guests, 35 will not give
[22:27:04] <traffz007> I can make access to our toadstool and there connect with hacker operator
[22:27:23] <traffz007> and you contact them directly there, they will give you access to chats, etc.
[22:27:57] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> well it makes no sense just less, we say 50/50 work, but there's still affiliate take their 20%, but since you have 100% ready to pay for 35... the mat will be a lot and stable, there are 10-15 nets a week, of course there are less... say 3-5, not always as they say "catch" good
[22:28:27] <traffz007> got it, I'll offer it to the boss, if he agrees I'll write back

Do you have a friend who owns exchanges?
You can get good money through the exchangers from the U.S. accounts, non-transparent
The amounts are very good.

are there any exchange owners?
in short, exchangers can request money from the account
banyans for example
I have accounts with large balances, but the banks are self-registered and cannot send money from them, just pulling money from them, exchanges is the norm, but the top exchanges limit 5k per day, I thought maybe you have the owners of exchanges

I pulled up a team of arbitrageurs, they do global traffic from fb and google, they have their own loader but they deal with cryptotheme in general, I offered them to try to work on networks, I say you do the traffic, we ourselves monitor networks, if anything we share, and the logs on crypto and others that will come - all to them. Should start next week.

Tom is also kind of starting on Mondays, we provided him with everything he needed.

I received an offer from a type of competitors, affiliate crylock - they say they are there like broke, they have pentesters, targeting, they only need a locker. I said okay, we'll give them 30%, they refused, they said a lot. I must squeeze them and try to steal their adversaries and pentester, I think how to pull this))).

I only need a locker, but actually 30% would not work for me. Because the big teams I had were working for a lower percentage, and I still have to earn something from administration.

Hi
Question from a subscriber (admin coder):

Listen, you do not know by any chance why in the admin area is the corporate section?
It's where it accumulates domains that pass through us and collects titles like title, description

Hi
I ran out of access to the XX
and now they have conditions like this.
Good afternoon. New working conditions, as xx introduced payment for each resume.
 
1. Access Sj + rent an office Hh (the best offer)!

    - month: 15 tr;
    - Week: 7 rub;
    - 3 days: 5 tr;
    - day: 4 tr.
    
Superjob limit 25 resumes/working days, no time limit. Hh already has 75,000 contacts open. Open resumes are not burned out for a year. About 25% of resumes will be free for you as they are already open by other managers in our company. For each resume pay in advance 60 rubles (instead of 73).
 
2. Access Sj.

    - month: 13 tr;
    - 2 weeks: 8 tr;
    - Week: 5 tr; 3 days: 3 tr;
    - 3 days: 3 rub;
    - 1 day: 2 rub.
    
Limit 25 resumes/working days, no time limit. This site is enough to cover 80% of jobs.

3. renting our office on Hh
 
    - month: 7 tr;
    - Week: 4 tr;
    - 3 days: 3 rub;
    - day: 2 tr.
 
For each resume pay in advance 60 rubles. (instead of 73). You can open as many tabs with resumes as you want and see all information except contact information, and pay only for the resumes you need. Also open resumes are not burned, and available for a year. About 25% of resumes will be free for you, because they are already open by other managers of our company.
 
If you still have questions, here's my work number, I'll tell you everything in detail 89062696551
 
Answers to the most common questions:
 
1. How do the open resumes count?
You can open as many resume tabs as you want and see all the information except the contact information. If you click on the "Open Contacts" button, you will be credited with 1 view. At the bottom of the program you can see how many resumes you have available.
 
2. How do I pay for a resume package?
First you determine how many resumes you need and pay in advance for the necessary amount. If you don't have enough resumes, you can buy more by giving me 24 hours' notice.
 
3. How many resumes can I look at in a day?
As many as you want as part of your package, even all in one day.
 
4. What do you mean resumes can burn out?
For example, if you pay the rate for a week or a month, your resumes will be open during that period. We pay for a year, so resumes won't burn out.
 
4. Will some resumes be open?
Yes, some resumes are already open to you, and over time they will be 30-35% open. That is, out of 10 resumes, about 3 will be available.
 
5. How do I get access?
The cabinet is accessed through a special program - this is dictated by security conditions. Otherwise, everything is the same.
  
6. How many people can use a purchased cabinet?
One cabinet - one user, if you need more users, buy an additional cabinet.
 
7. At what point does the access time begin to run?
As soon as I sent the login/password.
We're interested in this: 3. Renting our office on Hh

If you still have questions, here is my number working, I'll tell you everything in detail 89062696551
Arneda cabinet 7k + need to fill the account (60rub one opening of the contact infos). you can try to test dropping $ 12k is 200resumes that fit our description. as a result 7k + 12k = 19k

[19:45:41] <mango> By the way, here's another loader with admin in torus. just at arbitrageurs. Only written, wasn't in battle, and runs with OB sert bypassing smarscreen. If you suddenly need for what topics...


this is just right for tom, and for those who drive traffic

[20:13:18] <mango> Question from subscriber (admin coder):

Listen, you do not know by any chance why in the admin area is the corporate section?
It's where it accumulates domains that pass through us and collects titles like title, description
Is it in use right now?



it's not used, but in general it's very handy

So that's it. Add:
revers@ - hacker operator, normal person, he will give a coba, will keep in touch from us, will give access to the chat as movements go
hors@ - the second team of hackers, hors also smooth type, if there suddenly there are some gaps in the first with the paiload - you can go to the second, they are all familiar, no big deal, I try to load all evenly.
bentley@ - collects crypts on the trick, loader, cobs, verashells and other things, if something is urgently needed, you can say that from me and he will do everything.
Buza@ team leader for coders, if you need some modifications/consultations you can go to him. He is also the head of OSINT intelligence at our company, you can use him to request a breakthrough of some information on some companies.
That's all, if you need more hackers or some other people to help

something fucked up with crypts again, the outlet complains that only hanypots are flying from their uploads. i'm sure they're uploading incorrectly for some reason. My reasoning is this. If you tap the file with hanypot - it will tap and sucker. Another question is how they give it away, if they spam by bit attaches - hanypots are inevitable... Asked for reports on crypts and stubs - everything works. Hough cleans up the sources. So I don't see a problem on our end. Tomorrow I will test everything on my virtual machines with my own hands and we will try to figure it out. But most likely they are either spamming incorrectly or cockerel bases...

Hello, little brother.
I fucked my brains out about the crypts, let's look for an alterantive for the dink (it behaves inadequately and takes too long to check it) and we'll watch the runtime tomorrow. According to all the reports we have all clear on static, and what is checked by hand for rantime - they say clear. Either they are bullshitting or the servers load incorrectly since the Honeypots are knocking and the live machines are not
They want to bring together all our spammers in one chat, I think that this is unnecessary... The first reason is that there are 5 spammers, 4 of them are mediators...

Let's see what's changed in the meantime.
It'll all work out.
Yeah, I'll talk too.
And you talk to him.
Add him here.
please
Yeah. Yeah.
When the def shows up.
Add the man from balzac to group 6.
Let's get him an account.
Group 5, that is.
hi) no news?
Yeah, okay.
There's a problem in the bk.
I think it's the network.
It's not knocking.
It's probably on the routers.
Talk to the booze.
Help him solve it.
I got it)
Hi, yes we can solve it, I asked Zeus to give me the file dokach\hls himself, or better to send straight to the mail to check the whole chain by hand

As a result, the client accesses samba and sends

here's an idea
it needs to be given to someone
and test it quickly
ask around to see who's willing to do it
and check it out in a couple of days
ok we'll do it
Damn, we didn't say enough.

Sure! I think in your other email, you specified that you will like the following datasets:

    IP to Geolocation
    IP to ASN
    IP to Company
    IP to Carrier Detection
    Privacy/VPN Detection
    IP WHOIS (RWHOIS + RIR)
    Hosted Domains

Which pretty much constitutes as all our datasets and we offer a great combined price of USD15k/month for monthly updates. Weekly will be USD18k/month and daily will be closer to USD20k/month. Note that for all 3 options, we offer the standard 2 months discount (so x10 instead of x12) if you pay a year up front e.g. USD150k/year for monthly updates.

Hope that made sense and let me know if pricing works for you! I can also get an official quote out for you if you like.

Cheers

That's a fucked up price tag on that IP info.
There's a 15k a month subscription.

87 of which are for payroll and three for consumables.

The amount is growing slowly, we have 3 new coders receive already, Gold (the question of how much to pay him?) And admins there a little bit of new who also already receive for the past 2 weeks.


And Hesh wrote and said he agreed with you to buy 100vps for his mailing list.
Listen, what are we doing about the carbon? ))))) It's bought, waiting to be delivered. My guys are fucked up, they say you oligarchs just gave up on the whole thing...
You also said you needed some processors, any information?
m by the way, hash has two dudes who buy some routine stuff, do we pay them? should we also include them in the mix? or are they freelancers?)
I don't know about the hash yet.
For expenses, talk to Revers.
his team who will pay the salary, we do the same, or he is ready to take it on himself?
Understood I will.
Godl how much do you give the salary?
Who's that?
Your guy told me how much.

I had a situation that one of the coders raised his own salary from 2 to 2.5k, I said, but who raised it with who agreed? And he said the headhunter is constantly bombarded with newsletters from our company and he said that you`ve been tracking the rate for a long time, the offers that come from work))))
 I get email offers from our company 🙂
19:38
it's like
19:38
the headhunter writes and indicates the raid
19:38
got it)))
no one tells me anything as usual i find out everything myself))))
19:39
Yes it was so - once Stern said let's throw 70k, I thought once. Then I get an offer on my email.
And so on.
Three times it came.
We should change the accounts from which they are looking for people, we'll get caught sooner or later... I think there are plenty of snakes with such an approach to security...
The most talked about guys in our field, and there's a lot of leakage all the time, the infrastructure, the files... it turns out that even the xx tracks the shit out of us because they have been pouring from the same accounts for years

Hey, it's okay. I did what you said I did, I texted Zeus. But he has not said anything about the bk yet, and so I communicate with him periodically. Plus I'm aware of when he has some other problems on the admin or other modules. With coders and testers in touch, now we are trying to fix the import. On vntz and antic in progress, the coders are trying to rebuild.

Are you expecting work today?
I'm out of the office.
I created a gm@ account for zolotoy.
ghbdtn
hi
Ask him to do the following as well.
The encrypted message received from professor@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion is unreadable, as you are not currently communicating privately.
Sure! I think in your other email, you specified that you will like the following datasets:

    IP to Geolocation
    IP to ASN
    IP to Company
    IP to Carrier Detection
    Privacy/VPN Detection
    IP WHOIS (RWHOIS + RIR)
    Hosted Domains

Which pretty much constitutes as all our datasets and we offer a great combined price of USD15k/month for monthly updates. Weekly will be USD18k/month and daily will be closer to USD20k/month. Note that for all 3 options, we offer the standard 2 months discount (so x10 instead of x12) if you pay a year up front e.g. USD150k/year for monthly updates.

Hope that made sense and let me know if pricing works for you! I can also get an official quote out for you if you like.

Cheers
Ken

Why weren't the links deleted immediately?
hello
I downloaded the report.
I have a working battery, can not change yet if it is already charged
for example from next month
and another thing: since we have a lot of those who are looking for now, maybe how to distribute the search (let some people look for fresh resumes that are updated daily, and others scour the old that were added six months ago)? because I found a great specialist and found it just inactive, those who dropped the resume and forgot and not updated. but you know the responses from those who are looking for fresh. what do you think?
Good afternoon, from August 1, 2020 hh.ru introduced the biggest change - it switched to a new model of working with resumes. Now opening one resume will cost 60 rubles. The official rates hh here https://hhcdn.ru/file/16899324.pdf I can give you access to 10 times cheaper:
 
Hh.ru (Moscow time by choice: 08:00-11:00, 11:00-13:00, 13:00-15:00, 15:00-17:00, 17:00-19:00, 19:00-00:00, 00:00-08:00)

everything is up and running, not so fast, but you can work, they say.
they say it's not so fast, but it's workable. the server side will help us to output the listing for IDS, now it only hash out the IDS, but tomorrow it will help us to get the data for Vnts right in the admin area after the start.

Hi
I guess the domain died.
We'll make a new one.
Here's the torus for now. http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/
Hi
The domain continews.click is dead.
Oh, no.
The gasket's jammed.
The coder's gonna come in and reload.
The domain is the same as continews.Click.

It's not dead.

We're going to start testing this weekend.
What good will it do?
Overlapped I/O

hello
here?
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
I've got a little challenge for you
here
Say .
yeah
♪ you'll get a knock from driver@ ♪
there's a problem with the dero.
What's the problem?
the real data is causing errors in the crash logs
and if you do a direct query manually, it passes.
There's something in the data.
 Hi.
I guess you have to do some kind of validation.
So the data you get doesn't match the expected data
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Well, we'll have to see what kind of crash it was.
If you give me the log, I can tell you what to do.
hello
I can't get requests from the clients to the derot.
I don't quite understand how it is possible to debug everything.
In the logs now in crash.log is the following

I understand it's crashing somewhere on the input, I did info level but as I see there's not even data about the request that puts everything in.
[Error: message is encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
I do by hand when everything is ok, but by hand I make a request like /xxxxxx/TEST/60
I understand there are several stages of interaction with real clients, it seems to me somewhere in the first stages he gets something wrong.
now look at the source code
the driver will send you
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted]
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
I think he's expecting http data stream to have some values. and the input is empty
parse_method(<< C, Rest/bits >>, State, SoFar) ->
 case C of
  $\r -> error_terminate(400, State);
  $\s -> parse_uri(Rest, State, SoFar);
  _ -> parse_method(Rest, State, << SoFar/binary, C >>)
 end.
here is the code
parse_method works only when there is an input data stream ... it expects string translation ... but there is no data in fact
[Error: message is encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
I've decrypted everything. That's why it crashes.
maybe the client forgets to insert the line break at the end?
Is there any way to find out what he sends as input?
It turns out not valid http data?
i think so.
To know - probably only by modifying cowboy. This is a liba-server to work with http
Strange that the entire log is full of it.
Maybe there's something else wrong with it, but I can't look any further with these crashes until I figure it out.
I sent it to the wrong place, sorry.
the crash log will always be clogged with something. there are a lot of requests. each one gets something in the log.
Usually when everything is fine there's almost nothing there, but when there's a problem.
I have it filled in 5 minutes like this.
Def it as a signal that something unforeseen happens.
Uses
Usually errors on the warning, error level drop and everything is clear.
We check the http request itself, the one who is responsible for it says that he has an idea what to look at, thanks for the tip, myself I would have broken my head here for what it may be.
) are you sure you have a problem...
is there something going on here?
i got kicked out of the mailing list (i suspect a bummer). and i do not know all the data that were specified when registering, because i bought the mail. all that i have worked, now i can not recover ((
now with the new will again duplicate everything. probably with gmail, it seems they do not block
Well, it's certainly not up to me )
Ask def, maybe he'll tell you.

[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I have a question. Do you know what it is? ejabberd can be made to work through socks5 ... so it makes connections to servers through a proxy?
you have a way to make the jabberd work in onion?
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
yeah
you set up a torrc
prescribing the redirect port, which will receive to the onion domain and direct to the localhost
 how do you make outgoing connections ? for example how can I connect to a different onion-server ?
this is already more complicated, you probably need to send all traffic exiting to tor soks
i did not make a connection between servers, no need
but in general it is realistic ?
I think so

on vnts, put in the pink start and get data to connect vnts new
on Mon, let's start identification by the IDi in the Vnts list
on the dpost we do data transfer with ssl, before it worked without
we've come up with a way to generate new certificates on the main pads on the trike every hour
which will give a better bounce
and a constant rotation of rotary pads
we'll have it all up and running in Mon, we're in the process of doing it now
and this will be extended to bk and cobalt
+ there will be a constant change of parameters, it will be more difficult to track by certificates and fingerprints
and other software

I've been seeing some new features popping up, and I'm getting worried. There's a story here that I was planning on taking a vacation.
I want to have time to rest, summer is coming to an end, I'm a year without rest.
In this regard, I would like to ask you not to fill the next 3-4 weeks with new challenges to the functionality. I will try today, tomorrow at most on the check AB finish, I have the data, but with regulars need to finish.

I will make an unloading on the tax, and fix the logpost, finish the cookies with Nicholas and pass the system for support, I do not know exactly who, but we are discussing.
I'll be back from vacation and we'll quietly continue to develop the system. Right now I see that the priority bugs to quietly work 3 tascas (1 from you and 2 from Robin).
I will be back from vacation and ready to continue to develop the system and the chips in it already.
Do you think there is a way to limit the requests for new features for now?
Hi ok
what else have you added ?
[Error: message encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
I wrote, the Created field with the ability to sort is now there , You can make the newest bots.
And check Group IPs gives us 1 ip 1 bot, the most recent, it turns out that gives the offline bot, but you can filter by status and everything is ok then.
Box and check box in botlist section, field Check AV I finish, probably will need some filter to be able to get only bots with no AV in botlist?
Or the field is enough, and the filter is not needed?
I think so far only a field to see what AVs are on the bot
Ok, I do not think that more than 2 who puts, put in this box the name (I) AV just yet.

In general asked to pour new assemblies bots and test on the stand, agreed with the booze, now will need when eugene asks to fill in the stand first module pour there
We will test it and then in the software.
It will be necessary to give him a bot that is configured for the test bench.
Now with the bench access issue is solving, I will give him the account.
This is another point, what rights to give testers at the booth in the admin panel?
I don't really want to give up my root account.

Another question about vntz 2, did you change the command there?
What does it take to load vnts 2 on the bot?

You're doing it right.
There's a problem with the gasket.

hello!


I do not want to snitch or something like that, but we have this stuff everywhere and in everything, I am just wildly stressed, I try to move them all, but for all the shit to keep track of.
And it comes to the absurd, like ordering a server and waiting a week, then I write to everyone why they did not issue, the answers are dumbest, like I was thrown by the seller. Or here, Love for example had to buy an account - I have no PAP accounts, and I can not buy them anywhere.
How much do I pay for it, bro? - 70 bucks. I say, well, what are you like an idiot, could not make a week, and from the WTC to refill the account and pay - I have no WTC.
You're the one they complain about.
you're so stupid with the payments, what you do in 2 hours, it takes you a week to do it
I'm still on vacation, I leave on 30.08. In general, they report that everything is normal.

Hey, me too.
Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What challenges are you facing?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... What ideas anyone has.
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other people will create their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

It's not about them being brainiacs and will\not pay, it's about our attitude towards the adversaries. Since we are a top affiliate, we have to comply. From our side should always be clear and on time. Moreover, we have such a resource involved. All the opportunities and conditions are there, it is necessary to be more professional. And we have always one or the other. That we garbage in chats, then half a day do not answer the patient. Naturally ADVERS get nervous after that.

If you keep in touch, let me know.

Hi. I'll be in touch.
yeah
Talk to the driver tomorrow afternoon.
There's something in the dereo that needs to be sorted out.
crashes are coming
Maybe you can fix the software so it doesn't crash even if the data is invalid
so the only problem is that the log is shitting?
and suspicion that the database does not write
maybe write readable information in the log
what's wrong
the xttp protocol on the client side is wrong ...
I can't control it.
is it really the case
or change the libu that works with https
exactly
on the server side?
will it help?
not sure it will help. but maybe something else will.
At least it will be possible to intercept in the log. Then it will not shit
Let's do it.
I'm talking about "no guarantee of results"...
I need you to figure out the driver and the coder, help me with that.
tell me how much later
It's just that without you it's a dead phone
the module coder says that everything is fine, the driver does not see the data and sees crashes
and it's been going on for a long time.
Ok. I need to build a confab.

Ah, the driver did not add here.

It's working for me.
Look, .
you know the http protocol, right?
I do. I should expect some plain text.
I'm having trouble with the word "there".
i don't) i just have a problem. i don't see a normal http

others too
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type:
Content-Length:
Content-Encoding:

Next, the body of the request
Are you saying there are no headers at all?
you downloaded the files?
I downloaded the
They don't have http headers.
Sometimes there are normal ones ... with POST
or you get headers like these in the files.
you get a request without any headers at all
[Error: The message is encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
right?
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Well, you've seen what's coming in
because I reset the torus on the server.
this is very postmodern, but I can also assume it's http/2.0.
Keep an eye on it.
That's your responsibility.
should it be there at all?
although I do not remember that at least one of the modules was converted to support it
i don't know anything from the files yet.
it's still not clear what it is - is it the value of the Data field? i can't guess like that.

It shouldn't be there, but I can guess why it might be there.
So there was no problem.
From what I can see, only you and Elroy are out.
Everyone else was in place
like the result of a query conversion on a pad
the good.raw file shows http 1.1
I don't know anything from the files yet.

> we need the raw http request flown in as it is
I've already shown you what's coming to me. This is raw data.
Let's wait to see what the defender says.
or because someone redid the module on winhttp stack with http/2 enabled and didn't tell anyone
well that's fucked up
and you can send me a good request, you say it's a normal POST ?
so you can see it's fine.
Yeah, I can. I'll filter it out.
the point is, it's not just one module that sends data to the dero
the point is that it's not just one module that sends data to the dero
the point is there's more than one dero module sending data
the point is there's more than one dero module sending data

If you want to put pressure on me and think that it will make me work better, you're wrong.
[22:29:37] <dgh> https://file.io/aFft29MLJJvM
sffsgpcXGH!@$
[22:30:57] <dgh> Accepted?
If you intend not to let me go on vacation if something isn't finished, and I suspect it might be, you'd better create a booze confab right away and let's discuss this point
I'll buy the tickets and I won't redo anything if something goes wrong.
[22:32:26] <dgh> And in the end I'll just go no matter what happens, I want it too much. I don't want unnecessary problems. But I'm not ready to go on some unclear conditions either.
There's a list of tasks I'm ready to do and I'm doing it, we've agreed on it.
[22:33:13] <dgh> Everything from above is not just my responsibility.
It's at least yours, booza's, and nikolos'.
[22:33:24] <dgh> I take my part and what I can do.
[22:34:50] <dgh> more than I can do anyway, if in this tone of talk will continue - it does not suit me.
Again, you want to push me like that, let's have a discussion. And either look for someone else like you wanted or let's negotiate. I'm tired a lot and I'm also sick and tired of nothing working.

Talk to the driver.
He's fading out.
thinks I'm pushing him.
but in fact, there's a lot that hasn't been done.
he's nodding at everyone but he's had at least six months to get into it
I think he fucked it up.
I need to find a replacement, but in the meantime, let him finish what he's doing.

If it did, it should put a new entry in the database.
can you see this record?
there's nothing else there ...

neither the first nor the second?
There's nothing in the logs.
Yeah. .
So maybe it's not us?
maybe it's the search bots and so on?

or search and teach through xx
you don't need admins there, you just need someone with knowledge of linux and the ability to monitor traffic

The whole story about this conf was with the message that we had to change the parsing lib to make the logs, which zulas told us about, but the DEF came up with just putting a proxy andjinx. So I honestly don't really understand, there are no more edits in the back yet.
But there is a problem that some of the data does not come and we need to understand why and then continue to think.

crashes may actually happen all the time ... like when a different protocol on the port connects ... then there may be a crash in the log . it does not mean that the service is down . it just means that one particular request did not cause the right reaction the server

you need to find 2 grina admins to buy and configure a coba, you can look for someone with experience on the forums
or search for one and teach it through xx
you don't need super admins there, you just need to know linux and know how to monitor traffic
[09:52:35] <mango> buy 5 pcs.
[09:52:45] <mango> let him tell them what they need and buy it
and most importantly they should be able to e.g. setup a web server and bind it to a domain, understand hoster settings - dns, etc., plus they should understand cloud providers azura amazon ocean, etc.

elon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion: Greetings. Finished testing the spambot. Ready to release the assembly as a dll. We only need two things:
1) need to know for which bot dll, ie, what entry point to make there (with what to run it will be)
2) Need a server, the previous one is not paid (or I do not see the wrong version), so you need to order it again, we can order and deploy, but we need confirmation.
It is almost the same for the exe. But for the dll - you need to know to correctly make the entry points in the dll

And what kind of errors can the sump return? It's desirable to handle them somehow.
I added 403 to this request. On the module came 404 and 500. I guess 500 is from the gasket.

There's no base64... you added it yourself, obviously.
Well, it's not obvious for everyone.) We have their own part of the job, who does what - often unknown.
everything is just text.

where have you been )
Zulas are you going to change the base for the new fields too?
If yes, then please don't do it, I'm doing migrations and I want all changes in database to be reflected in them.
I have written migrations for two fields secure and httponly
Both logical.
I won't do it .
And the 90 team added new fields
have you changed the base on the worker already ? can i dump ?
the fields will not be saved if there are more ?
dlls, programs, services I already added.
Oh, okay.
I haven't done it yet. I'll do it in a second.
I need a desktop shortcut field there but I haven't added it to the migration yet.
It's not in the back either.
Add it all at once so I don't have to come back.
Not yet. I will have time later this evening.
There need to add this field in other parts, so I will not be able to do it quickly.
On the 2 fields in the cookies rolled migration.

Hi

elon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion: Greetings. Finished testing the spambot. Ready to release the assembly as a dll. We only need two things:
1) need to know for which bot dll, ie, what entry point to make there (with what to run it will be)
2) Need a server, the previous one is not paid (or I do not see the wrong version), so you need to order it again, we can order and deploy, but we need confirmation.
It is almost the same for the exe. But for dll - you need to know how to correctly make the entry points in the dll.
With what bot may be tested? Bk? Or a tribot?

hi, if you do, please email me - urgently please wait
no about the base64 ... added themselves obviously
Well, not for everyone obviously ) We have each part of the job, who does what - often unknown.

Here is the question. Why can it be that I make a request, back answers /1/ but in the info level logs no request, while in the database of the data I passed, too.
It is written in back that /1/ is always about the answer 200, but I noticed that he answers /1/ and if the bot is in the database and if it is not.

1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So that others already created their coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

what's up with Prof.
he's not happy
send me a list of his projects
because he is not emotionally
that nothing is finished
and even 2 weeks changing servers for abuses on the anchor

[20:07:20] <professor> did you see how they obfacated ?
[20:07:24] <professor> about the affiliation ?
[20:07:30] <professor> i almost fucking burst the fuck out
[20:07:37] <professor> they cut a piece of trikbot code that's responsible for tapping on CIS
[20:07:41] <professor> into the diabolus build

[20:07:48] <professor> although I specifically asked not to touch the task with the definition of geo
[20:07:58] <professor> and immediately the whole project appeared in the news as fully affiliated
[20:08:34] <professor> https://www.securitylab.ru/news/523552.php
and who approved it ?
fuck
