Greetings. Created cryptor subprojects in redmin. Still have a problem with permissions.
If I create a subproject without inheriting rights, only I am there and only as a developer.
If I create a project with rights inheritance then my rights are inherited and others, but it is not possible to remove extra developers, because they are inherited.
Please correct rights if possible)

External
For the connection.
Goes to 4022 inside
You need a 4022
external
So it'll be empty.
Why? Internal any, external 4022.
That's not how it works.
The login ip is a big server with internal virtualization
I'll open up a port on it-- 4022.
But it won't have any rules to communicate with the virtualization
The ingress IP is a big server with internal virtualization.
I'll open up a port on it. 4022.
But it will not be prescribed rules for interaction with the virtualization

Found him already, says the computer died. Took me three days to rebuild it.
Do you have a chance to run a lawyer through the US?
See if there's any possibilities there. I need some backup on the Alka...
e vtyz ytne
I don't have one.
Hey. .
fuckin' .
look at the thing about alka... she is not an immigrant, she has all her relatives there, citizenship, etc. she has 50 cases - episodes according to ours. she is a Russian hacker, the case will be political, most likely
They gave me a lawyer, they said the best one, plus great connections, he knows the investigator, he knows the judge, he is a federal lawyer, licensed and so on. he got acquainted with the case, he says it is hard, but you can come up with something, to start with you should get the minimum and then try to get out sooner, you will not be able to go to jail
She's looking at 30 years to life.
Holy shit
Well, we have to help her.
And also...
the case will last a year or two at best. he says the whole process will cost 150,200,000, you can do it in two installments.
We have to get the whole case.
I can give you all his info.
It's expensive, there's no point in trying.
He can only get the case if he's handling it
We need to find a lawyer who's sane.
The second thing is we need someone to make the agreement at all.
And if it's a good idea, it's relatives.
What do you mean, a sane one? Pay him a month?
Here they do everything in white, the contract from their law firm and so on and so forth. and this is for the entire process, it will not be less in any case
I can give you his details. You go on there, or check him out. That's all I can do.
You have to take it one step at a time.
You have to get the whole case first.
That's only if he's her lawyer.
No one will give him anything like that.
That's not the only way.
We'll have to go through someone else.
It's a tough case, when they started to find out, they said that the FBI has a very close control of the case, they've been looking for a week for someone to sign off on it.
let's go this way. try it yourself through someone else. try to get a lawyer that I will give, and you have to at least within a month to make a decision
I will try to talk to pay in installments, but they assure me that everything is in good faith according to the contract, they have a license and everything...
I'm waiting for an answer then, I've got them on my trail
i got a couple of people for hors, a couple more admins... i'm trying to fight with cryptors, but so far we're having a hard time with vatakat, i don't understand detection...
what other tasks are there if you write.
i have a feeling that i am a bit short on payroll - i gave it all away, i managed to fix it before the bitcoin fails, i still have about 1k left and i'll take it tomorrow
https://ibb.co/jVpZngt

There's a picture there of the lawyer's contacts. He was also given by serious guys, and I'm sure of him, because I know people who recommended him. If you find a better one, I'm all for it. But that's all I can do for now.
Here's another thing before I forget, there's someone who gives you access - he wrote that he had problems with the bot with it, asking if we can rent the software and on what terms?

yeah, you said you're good at asterisk
we need to make an autodial
on targets from different numbers what do we need to buy for that?
hello
Yes, I have experience of work and settings.
Auto-targeting by directory.
yes
we will deliver directories simply numbers there
You need a virtual server to install asterisk, the phone number from which the call will be made
Phone numbers will change
As far as I understand it is necessary to buy sips
I do not know asterisk
what will be the city numbers to be switched
depending on how many numbers will be switched
change the numbers
and the numbers should be american or something
or European
ideally buy them for a bit
Well, if anything, they'll just be pasted
from the left plastic
how often will the outgoing numbers change
oh, I don't know.
We'll think about that.
Then here's what you need to understand.
how often the outgoing numbers will change.
I will find out how to buy European or American numbers
need a virtual cloud resource where Asterix will be located, if there is no such resource, I can also analyze this market
the purpose of the caller ID? to understand if the number is alive or not?
no part of the call to demand a ransom and fuck the top managers with it
sometimes they don't say anything.
I get it. It's just an automatic call.
They need to be reassured.
is there a resource for setting up a phone server, a virtual server?
Of course I do.
I'll give you a server.
All right, then I'll gather information on the phone numbers for cost and purchase
for the bit.
Yeah great
Well, then it should be understood that the numbers will be blacklisted, I will think about how to track it so that the numbers are not used in spam in the future
Yeah, okay.
How often autodialing will happen every day or another algorithm
how many calls the top managers should autodial
for example
2 calls a day from different numbers and so on during the week.
well, or another algorithm
Hello
Yes, it's coming.
More likely to be ready by the end.

check just before you throw paiload shell on domain/API so there were no alerts
I check on the MH toolbox. There's a blacklist there.
drop in a paiload, put together a container with this shell, or just a bunch of randomized shells.
if there will be no detects and everything will be fine - let's stick it to the builder as a function

[00:27:29] <mango> got a guy in our rocket - will form the department of analysis and blackmail :)
[00:27:44] <mango> we should think of a method to search data on targets, where and so on
[00:28:04] <mango> if you have any developments - share brotherly
[00:28:09] <mango> for the common good :)
[00:33:59] <hors> Not much experience, but I can tell you that you need a hard policy and limit the time, otherwise they already start to think up a fucking thing, 3 cases so merged
[00:38:19] <mango> no no
[00:38:31] <mango> it's about finding contacts and collecting information
[00:38:36] <mango> search through social networks and so on
[00:38:44] <mango> here's how to analyze
[00:38:47] <mango> I look what I think
[00:39:29] <mango> we should as soon as the case came into work - immediately to gather information as soon as lock - we already had established the right contacts, phone numbers, their partners, and options how to push on them
[00:39:30] <hors> there's all the info in ad_users, there's all the employees and their mail, names, etc.
[00:39:33] <hors> and positions
[00:39:45] <mango> that's how
[00:39:58] <mango> if you pick up date - provide us these contacts at least for study
[00:40:27] <hors> Sure
[00:40:31] <hors> We'll give out everything at once
[00:40:33] <mango> anything you take from network - anything that will help us to analyze it would be cool of course
[00:40:40] <mango> somehow everybody should coordinate
[00:40:45] <mango> so it wouldn't all come down to us)
[00:41:17] <hors> will you add me to the rocket?
[00:41:19] <mango> you need to tinker with tin. you got the timing right

[00:42:05] <hors> yes, study in detail the information we take from them
[00:42:10] <mango> not just pour it on mega

With Horse also mussed the topic of redemption, I understand that pay all very reluctantly, it is necessary to press harder... On the timing of limiting dunno sure how, 2 weeks is quite acceptable, because many take loans, etc.. I think that it is necessary to analyze the deeper and creep it that we leak that is expensive for them, but not everything, plus we must be harder to pressure, annoying phone calls, annoying partners, cover in the media... I propose to organize the work so that by the time the local have a full report on the analysis: top management, contacts, their personal data, what we find partners, their contacts, and most importantly calculated strategy, how to pressure that for which targets is acceptable. We are tits up, bargaining like schoolboys, gangsters do not behave that way, all these concessions are useless, I did not even expect it from you :-D We just have to be realistic at first to put the price and stand firm on its own. And we start with a lakh and agree to 100k. Given the fact that the FBI is monitoring all these negotiations, I think they are making fun of us. There's a reason they're pulling all these negotiations, studying us, our wallets, etc... And if they are so damn relaxed and do not want to pay - let's have some kind of violent protest. Maybe a big plum what a loud, or even something that will attract attention, maybe even make lokov and plums without any redemption - a show flogging type) Discount there companies 30-50-100 - throw out all the data, who can break ... you can not even the big, but so that everyone was on the ear, so that others have strained and thought less ... And change the color of admins, we're locker, not tiffany :-D

[00:02:07] <love> not root, but admin ie.
[00:02:12] <love> well, the rights are not delimited there
[00:02:23] <love> I was surfing on domains and accidentally entered someone else's bot
[00:02:28] <love> then I messed around in admin

Hey, it's okay. We're working.
I'm bringing the newbies up to speed.
For alts, the api of exchanges is still on hold, I'm making an update for the cryptopanel, very requested it

On the stock exchange, Buza formed the terms of reference, now bought servers, will raise the old version and change it according to the terms of reference

Hi
You only got one spot for me, right?
There's cherry wants the ehel too.
Wants to pay his own way.
6k a month.
When will the second one start?
Next week?
Probably.
He's got a trick.
He's waiting for a certificate to sign.
Well, let's do the cherry for now, we'll deal with that later.
All right. Let's do the kosh.

Can we make it today?
Yohel with a uk.
Sure
If possible, with a built in load
With built-in on Monday we will do, I have not shown anything yet how to do
Okay, then with the usual. Let's do the script

Bro not you.
Ok)
Cherry there's been making a fuss about no one's echelle not working.
He was having a bad time at the time.
You got someone sending with our bk?
Not at the moment.
Have you ever sent?
Balzac?
I don't have a team of five.
Balzac did, he didn't.
Yeah. .
It didn't go either?
No
Did he have any dots?
I don't know why.
Or spam?
No
Spam
Weird
Let's try him with a built in load then.
Ok
Fuck, I accidentally deleted someone from the team and I don't know who))))
Bummer
When does he want to send?
If sap catches up fast.
Maybe we can do an embed today.
I'm just busy right now, so I can't build it myself.
Not till Monday.
Okay.
I'll show him how to do it anyway, so it'll be ready.
If he always has to have a built-in, there'll be room for a second one.
All right, we'll try it.
Hey
Have you installed the sock software?
Tell me and how do you clients send ehel? In a zip?
Yes
Just zipped without a password?
Yes

Hey, can you send the money to this address 1KfDPgc6CiWb6Fnin1bLWi2moX1ViXANxW ?
I'll try to find a way to send money to the lawyer by Wednesday, he started to rustle up some contacts for her relatives so far. 55 maybe even good, it will be easier to build a victim of circumstances...
Hey bro, the Spaniard wants to know the news and what's going on?
Hey bro, I don't know how it ended yesterday, I was out of town... I'm gonna ask you what happened again...
I don't know what to do.
You give me the bit, I give you the Sber, or what?
No, like last time... The guy has to pay with his card, and you pay me with Sber.
Hi bro, Spaniard wants to know what's new and what's going on?
Hi
privet bro
Privet bro!
The american guy is going to pay with bucks.
by 3 transactions

No. Like last time, the guy has to pay with his card. You pay me with Sber.
The American guy will pay in bucks.
In three transactions.
Hey, .
What is there to water?
Yeah
I only have bitcoin and that's it
Try it with a bk
you take bucks in bitcoins ... and withdraw the bitcoins in wood to me
Do you want a bitcoin cash?
fershtein?
here?
No
I understand that you need a ruble.
I'll use bestchange
I'll convert
And what will you transfer me?
How are things there
veron
)
When he's got something.
You'll get the bucks. I just need to set up payment references.
Remember 2 years ago we did the same thing?
I don't remember.
Yeah, there were bits and bobs.
A year ago. I looked it up.
I need to get some bucks from a guy.
Is there a way to pull this off?
yeah
no
I only have kosh bitcoin.
Or try mango.
he'll look at the exchangers
bestchange.ru
there's a bunch of different options
see for yourself
themselves are all reliable
I give a guarantee
on behalf of myself
I'll cover it if anything
> or try via mango
(20:09:26) admin: he will look at the exchangers

what kind of mango ? man ?
mango@
i don't have this person in contact .
he has mango@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion ?
this jabber ?
No, he's not.
somehow not alphabetical) shows
Hey, quick question. I was told you could help me.
Stern says you can help me.)
Yeah. .
I need to take dollars from a foreigner and convert them into rubles to my account.
can i do it via you ?
reliable ?
will not bail ?
change reshaev@ the design of his locker
yt rby
reliable yes.
Okay, thanks. I already wrote him.
I guarantee he won't cheat up to $60,000.
What about your tasks? ) I haven't heard from you for a year or more.
> I guarantee he won't cheat up to $60,000.
You got a hell of a laundering operation going on over there.)
hello
what country?
Is the money clean or dirty?
Clean... from a client... USA
How much? I need 12500k in the U.S. right now)))
He needs to form 3 links... so he can pay them... and then to me also by small transactions
5500
What do you mean form 3 links? What payment?
I do not know what kind of payment ... he wants to pay through a visa ... I do not know how to accept it without a problem ...
Unless it's through a dropper.
But they will want a commission of 20% or 30%.
I haven't done that in a long time.
That's not an option.
30's a fuckin' lot.)
Let him send 12500 and I'll give you the bits.)
I need 12500 too in the yus just the same...
I don't need no bits. You can't put 'em on bread.
We'll send you the money on the card through the money changer)
yes ... What about the 30% commission?
You have a roux card? I have money changers who will put it on the roux card, but I need to pay 12.5K to a US lawyer, can't your guy there help us out?
and we'll send him the bitcoins if we need them or you, whatever you want to do)
I can send it to your card.
He can send it to the right place ... but I do not know how to do it ... I don't have 12k.)
I don't have that kind of debt yet.
You're not in the U.S.?
i got it) then it will be different operations, i am busy looking for someone to exchange the money from us to btz
I'm not.)
If I find the guys, I'll let you know if they'll do the same for you.
The main thing is that there's no scam
Can't you set up a link for payment... so he can just pay... and you can get the BTS?
No bro, I haven't seen it that way.
It's hard to get money into the U.S.
Then my guy can pay the money to someone else... by direct transfer. The main thing is that it's clear that my guy paid and your guy accepted.
Ask him if he may need some bits, I'd send him 12.5)
I do not understand) if he needs the bits ... what does it have to do with your 12.5k? ) it's not bits
and you mean bits for 12.5k?
let's deal with my 5,500 first ? what do i tell him ?
yeah
tell him it's not 5,500, it's 1,500))))
he won't understand )
and we'll compensate him with the bit left over
and we'll send it to your card.
Then wait a couple of days.
Ok. But I'll text him.
I'll find a U.S. guy who'll take it - I'll ask you if you want it.
Do you want it?
Can you hold it till Wednesday?
I am still patient ... the man owes me a year and a half. my current service for him below the plinth .
I wrote him:
i have one solution about $5500 payment. I have man who should pay $ 12500 to some lawer from USA. So it could be an offsetting.
Also if you need bitcoins, this man can pay you bitcoins and you pay to this lawer the rest of amount. What do you think ? Does it works for you ?
Is it working for you ?
Yeah, it's OK.
Okay, I'm waiting for a reaction from you and him too.
but the last I heard from him, he's not interested in beats... maybe things have changed now.

Hi
Hi, how are you?
What are you up to?
I read your report

Hi, i think everything was done, everything was installed, i checked the backtest, i raised sls everywhere, all the missing softwares and modules were delivered... I think we're all set, ask him again.

Znaniu webinjektom with the ability to modify the code of the page. In the testing phase, but I would already be implementing it.
Working on a container to deliver load, made a builder to make it easier to assemble the container
Acquired Ciska looking for potential holes in it
the reverse engineer is still on the phone at the post office now doing the specs
elvira@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion is the new helper.
Hi. Support for documents with macros, loader, admin for the loader. Tasks are clearing detects.
Hi. All good. I am in the process of setting up servers. At this stage I am setting up a virtualization server for Mac OS.
I've been dealing with Booza's request
Yeah
I need more C++ people and reverbs for swift
That is, perhaps, all my current tasks. :)
hi
what's the task
Ok, got it.
It would be more organized, but because of the peculiarities of prodokshin I think it is not realistic. :)
hello
you can clean it?
Does anybody use your dock?
I want to use rtf to add load.
It's working so far

What about pupy?
Hi
how's it going
Are you able to make bots?
I just got on the defender team and was assigned this task.
Launched, looked, in general works. But everything is very unstable, the bot does not always reach, many modules do not work at all, just dumping root dumps. No webkit. Just like that, it's not real to start using it.
Hi. I make bootloader/bot builds every day. I clean them periodically. Periodically improving/changing them. When I'm not doing BC, I'm refining my crypt so it can be used on the server for automated builds.
Hi. I'm doing fine. I was assigned to Twin in Team_C. We're about to jump into a new grid.
Able to generate bots for different platforms, tied linux, android. Only looked at under Win
Hello, all is hot, locale is the last 2 large cases are waiting for bidding ...  Well, the work also have more cases, in passing trying to train newcomers in the team, the tasks have added their team will watch the trainings and other related things to do ... the issuance of servers novenkim and etc ... it is like all can not describe at once)) all is good moving forward
Business - good. Interesting and busy.
All of the cryptors switched from manual to automatic builds through build machine.
Now they are busy updating and cleaning stubs. And I make files on the build machine, check and issue. If something builds dirty, I go to
to the cryptor. He cleans the stub. Check it again and give it away.  
Tasks:
1. Crypting files for Leo on the build machine.
2. silk code cobalt.
3. lockers.
4. Coabalt eche and dll
5. dll trike
6. Teach and give other team members access to the build machine so they can build their own crypts.
7. Preparing links for load and testing echelles for netwalker, hash, cherry.
I've been waiting for a long time for a dedicated dedicated server with msf.
Hi. Things are fine.
Sorting out cryptobirch, protocols, api, etc.
Crypto exchange development task.
On vntz I'm dealing with a module crash bug when trying to decrypt passwords.
Hello, I work, it seems all the basic stuff goes well, I learned a lot here, and I learn... guys always show me something new, in general, everything works out
Hi, I am moving slowly.
I work with bot admins and know how to set them up, so far I have set up import and black.
I'm currently sorting out the supervisor and documenting it.
The task is to set up a test server and make a ngtwork column from one odomain to another
Generally there is a tasklist, there is a lot of stuff there.
The task is to make kind of stats on the data which came and where they went
network
And so everything is great everything is provided, :) thank you.
Hi how are you doing?
Hi! I am working on the fine tuning of the bot and the loafer. There is x64 version, which works, it has 1 detector on the non-main AB. There is the x86 version, which has more detects of AB, it needs to be cleaned. Now I am adding proto2 to bot and loader. The next task is just cleaning up the x86 version from detects. Before that I developed the looder in dll format for rundll32. There were some difficulties, but they have been resolved. The dll-loader works both on its own and as part of crypts
hi
how are things
how's it going with your uk?
does anybody use them?
Hey, how are you doing?
Kaktus is in charge of this. I do not know who to give what BC.
In general, to be honest, I would like to write, glad to work with you, the first place where I get pleasure)) thanks for the opportunity bro
I would have to check with him.

What challenges are you facing?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Hi. looking for me?
Hi!
I develop BC, give out builds on demand. There are a few tasks, which are mostly about changing the functionality of the BC.
As for improvements, I think it's far away, but there are ideas, I will describe them

Hi
I tried Elon's mailbot, it turned out that uploading it through bots is not an option. As Elon himself says there are some nuances and the upload fails for some reason. Elon is preparing a new module or something like that, to make mylebots upload through bots)
The last message I asked elon about redoing the module was the answer:
elon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion: Greetings. It's done, it's in testing.

Hi, it's good.
I apologize for not answering at once, it's been a long time since I communicated via toadstool, I didn't see what you wrote.
I'm just finishing a full report on the Intel ME controller mechanism and the AMT technology based on it.
Restored a bunch of undocumented commands by reversing, dumping the interaction interface and phasing.
Unfortunately the initial theory based on the presentation of Embedi/PositiveTechnologies reservers is not confirmed as they presented it, but there is another legal mechanism to activate AMT, but until the working POC was not reached, at the moment I am doing sniffer buffer which provides HECI interface, as it all configured in UEFI it took a little longer, after I fully restore the command set, the POC will be prepared.
Ideas are there, on the subject of uefi it's not just a load dropper but probably some SMM level handler daemon, plus since I'm studying the ME controller intimately now, there are ideas to test such functionality as overwriting a SPI stick through it. Usually this controller is allowed to write to the stick what you can't say about the processor, and some commands were found which are responsible for this functionality.

Hi!
Crypting, as usual. My testers say it works.
I spent few days for connecting my stub to build-machine.
I have not got any global ideas yet ))). And the little things I have to think about every day, - crypting is hard work,
as it turns out.
I've been working here for two years now. June 14 is my first two week vacation.
hi
I didn't work out with norbert, so I got fined.
I'm back on the crypto, I'll be done soon.
we can improve the encryption algorithm

i want you to chat with atlas and show him your cryptos
ok, i'll do it
i'll show him
i'll make the payment on two cards now.
Okay. .
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... Who has any ideas?
you're already out of the crypto business then)

Anybody out there who considers themselves a blockchain, and trending guru. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... Who has any ideas?
I don't get it.
hello
it's not turning on.
Who has any ideas on blockchain? and cryptocurrencies, where to go and what to develop. Who thinks they are the guru of crypto trends?
ok, no cp
We sent you the terms of reference for the filter.
not ready yet?
Hi. i don't remember anything about the terms of reference. when?
A long time ago.
I don't know.
probably forgot ... Remind me again?
In the admin room are knocking strange bots,
 need to add a filter to filter out such bots, do not give them configs (commands 23, 5) and
 commands to launch modules and files (commands 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 62):
 1) by ip (you can specify specific ip, or a whole range)
 2) by id:
  Kevin_W617601* - all bots whose id starts with Kevin_W617601
  *Kevin* - all bots, which have Kevin in their id
  you can specify a list of such filters
 3) by Version:
 	 Version < 1080
 	 Version == 1027
 	 Version != 1089
 	 Version > 1099
 4) by Group:
 	aver*
 5) by System:
 	Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
	Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
	Microsoft*
	*Microsoft
 These filters can be grouped, for example:
  Version < 1080
  System: *Microsoft
	etc.
is this about lero?
probably
I think there are some filters there.
Okay, I'll check with the admin.
Def's is better.
Yeah, he's got

Who has any ideas about blockchain and cryptocurrencies, where to go and what to develop. Who thinks they are gurus in crypto trends?
I was busy yesterday, I fancied some cool functions, like a personal file storage with possibility to share some files, closed clubs of interests, joining which would be checked by voting, open public groups for general discussion... System of user reputation to eradicate cheaters and meddlers and leave only really working guys... This also a bunch of services can be screwed, like grandmothers did last week, when they allowed to put the date to all comers hackers to their resources, even if they are not related to their locker - anyone can there any date to store ...

This is under this social network you can implement all your erotic fantasies in one place, and the exchange, and the file dump in the blockchain...
The amount of work is gigantic, without experience in administration we can't do it ourselves, I think it's necessary to attract some colleagues like hss... this will be the evolution of our underground into something more serious...

You Uncle think about it all plz, the topic is interesting, but very difficult... Let's be realistic, we own the whole omnibus of work is not enough people or experience is not enough, so the cooperation with the administrators of at least similar sites will be a very bold plus to us...
[Error: the message is encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted...]
How do you use these filters? I just figured out the ip.
Will it work ?
it's like that, but how to deal with it
what is not clear there ?
my client ate some characters
The rep has a full description of it.
can i have some examples of the following
1) by ip (you can specify a specific ip, or the whole range)
2) by id:
 Kevin_W617601* - all bots whose id starts with Kevin_W617601
 *Kevin* - all bots, which have Kevin in their id
 you can specify a list of such filters
3) by Version:
       Version < 1080
       Version == 1027
       Version != 1089
       Version > 1099
4) by Group:
      aver*
5) by System:
      Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
      Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
      Microsoft*
      #Microsoft
#{
  <<"x">> => 1,
  <<"y">> >> <<"hello">>,
  <<"ip">> { ip, <<"162.76.2.1">> },
  <<"true">>
}
then:

* 1 > 2 -> false
* x =< 2 -> true
* 1 ++ 2 = 12 -> true
* x ++ 2 = 12 -> true
* x ++ 2 = 2 ++ x -> false
* x ++ 1 = 1 ++ x -> true
* y = "*lo" -> true
* y = "*lo*" -> true
* y = "lo*" -> true
* !(x>1)&y=\"hello\" -> true
* y =& [ "*lo", "hel*"] -> true
* y =|[ \"lo*\", \"(hel*\"] -> false
* ip ~ \"162.76.0.0/16\" -> true
* ip !~ \"161.76.0.0/16\" -> true
here are all examples
That is, each client is some kind of properties ... see above ...
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop ... What are some of the ideas?
still don't get it.
If one of the rules is false the client is discarded.
Read it first.
What don't you understand?) ?
Please do some examples of the terms of reference
for example Kevin_W617601* - all bots, whose id starts with Kevin_W617601
how to write it in your version?
id != "Kevin_W617601*"
<<"true">> => true,
<<"false">> => false,
<<"id">> => client#client.client_id,
<<"client_ver">> => Client#client.client_ver,
<<"name">> => Client#client.name,
<<"group">> => Client#client.group,
<<"ip">> => Client#client.ip_parsed,
<<"country">> => Client#client.country,
<<"sys_ver">> => Client#client.sys_ver,
<<"importance">> => Client#client.importance,
<<"userdefined">> => Client#client.userdefined

here are the available column identifiers
so you have to write <<"id">> != "Kevin_W617601*"
?
why <<"id">> ?
it's from the source ... just write "id">> "= " ... "
## Available identifiers

The following client field identifiers are currently supported and can be inserted in the expression code:

* ``True'' is always TRUE
* ``false`` - always False
* ``ip`` - special IP type, you can match it with ~
* ``id`` - client id as text
* ``client_ver`` - client version
* ``name``` - client name (string)
* ``group`` - client group (string)
* ``ip`` - The ip of the client which was sent by the /0/ command
* ``country`` ``country of the client (string)
* ```sys_ver`` - system version (string)
* ``importance`` - number
* ``userdefined`` - number
Okay, now it seems to make sense

Didn't specialize in blockchain, although interesting. There is a hobby in studying Pampa/dump/listing processes and the soaring value of coins on the Binance crypto exchange. On the horizon is the use of an automated bot in these processes.
Hi, I have a lot of ideas.

Everything's fine.
Who has ideas on blockchain? and cryptocurrencies, where to go and what to develop. Who thinks he is the guru of crypto trends?
He understands what I'm suggesting.
good
he has the same topic for other countries
you can tell he's a pro.
and that dick won't get anything
because of his greed and mistrust.
He said about you so you could work, but they already get 250k
That's what I said.
If you'd negotiated more, he'd have agreed
that's the most they'll go for.
Professor's off the grid.
I told his people you were looking for him.
the thing about the negotiator is that he immediately says the maximum amount the company told him

Hi, what do you do here?
Hi. In a nutshell.

Find young forks on exchanges (those that can be mined), analyze their infrastructure. Where servers, nodes, capitalization.
Find a place where crypto holders communicate (discord, etc.).
Find out the IP of the nodes. Most likely to be IPv6. Begin to crack. Hop into chat room, found earlier and write that there is a problem, crypto is not displayed, operations are not conducted. (since crypto depends on mining, there will really be problems).
Holders get nervous and withdraw the main balance. Crypto drops in value. We buy at a low price. We let go of the ddos. Crypt goes up again. We come out in the black. Or the option of writing to the creators about the possibility of a buyback if they want the ddos to end. With the main problematic points being the implementation of Ipv6 ddos.
good idea
how to know ip - node ?
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
yes
got
But I don't get it.
we have a target of 10 reverses to have a lab.
How's the manhunt going? Is it difficult?
at least by the end of the year to gather
and distribute the tasks and get the results
if we need to buy iron.
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be deciphered.]
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
wrote 2 test messages
Find cold wallets, especially big holders, and watch what ip they connect to (roughly speaking, do reverse, these ip and will be nodes).
i have something stopped switching encryption
Did you see the message?
and i sent you a new public key
yes, i put it in.
1 test I see
Ah, there you go.
So it's working.
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
but how do I turn the encryption toggle button back on?
Look for the button on the right.
[16:04:38] <HOF_tsesar> here's another encrypted
not OTR
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I can see the button, but it is deactivated
1 2 3
i.e. you can't enable encryption
and before you could.
and you attached this new key to your account?
and now you've already reloaded it three times and nothing
I created it there.
Wait a minute
you created it in the plugin
Now select accounts.
there select the toad's account
click edit
and on the second tab select the key

Hi
Good afternoon. There is a 0-day privilege escalation exploit for Use-after-Free vulnerability in WIDFRD.sys driver. The exploit is implemented for Windows 10 x64 1607, 1703, 1709, 1803, 1809, 1903, 1909. It is present in 2004 and later, but the corresponding code in the driver was rewritten, and OS crashes in BSOD before the target vulnerability is triggered on null pointer dereferencing. There are some nuances on exploitation: not all systems may be vulnerable, as there is a dependency on hardware configuration. Exploitation takes place by disabling SMEP (CR4 modification), modifying PTE/PML4 if necessary, and executing code that performs token replacement of the target process with the system one. I publish the announcement here, because my regular customers do not need / do not fit, and in the personal from those who on the forum expressed a desire to buy, no one answers. The price of 60k, negotiable. Willing I can write and issue a utility, which when run on the system of interest will tell if the OS is vulnerable or not. The first contact in the PM, then in jabber.


I'll add:

The exploit is for sale in one hand.

Video of the work:

https://filetransfer.io/data-package/ctyCDTW6#link

Password bvdiviy2861rVJVl

 

What happens in the video:

1. The wud.exe process is launched, exploiting the vulnerability.

2. wud.exe creates a cmd.exe process and pauses for 5 seconds to check privileges.

3. I run notepad.exe (instance 1) from the created console.

4. After a while I check my privileges and run notepad.exe (instance 2).

5. In Process Explorer I check the level of cmd.exe and 2 instances of notepad.exe one by one. I can see that copy 1 is running with medium IL, and copy 2 (when cmd.exe's permissions were already elevated) with SYSTEM.
All in all, it's not so bad. The bots are going, 4 nets took the chors yesterday :)
Good morning. Waiting for the crypt files.
Good morning. Do we do the echelle?
Good morning, bro. Doing ehel today?

What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... Who has any ideas?
Hi!
So far we're getting to grips with the withdrawal of AD, ballooning, etc.
Got to the rasping
figured out the sonic.
I can't tell if I've improved anything in particular yet,
But, as I've learned for myself, it's very important for a beginner to consistently dive into the material:
I grabbed every case study I was called to look at at first, then older comrades advised me to deal with it one by one...
Draft it when you're online.
Afternoon. Doing today ehel?
I have a job for you. Knock on Bentley, get the cypted file from him and take it all the time, a file of uk and tric
Or you know where to get the tric.
Crypt it.
put it somewhere on the website.
or email it to yourself somehow
so you can download it from your chrome browser
directly
like
file.exe
and run it with the mouse.
with two keys
and it should bounce back to the admin area
Once you've done that.
tell me which krpter can do it
Test it out.
beta@ and atlas@
then come straight to me.
Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What challenges are you facing?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... Who has any ideas
hey what's your nickname on rocket?

Hi!
While we're getting to grips with the removal of the AD, the orb, etc.
Got to the unzipping.
figured out the sonic.
It's hard to say if I've improved anything in particular yet,
But, as I've learned for myself, it's very important for a beginner to consistently dive into the material:
I grabbed every case study I was called to look at at first, then my older comrades advised me to deal with it one by one...

Let me know when you do.

Hi
What are you doing?
Hey, how's it going with the locker?
Hi.
I dropped off the multipot. Got the new requirements for coding large files.
We'll finish it today or tomorrow.
Unexpectedly ran into a problem with working out AB on VSS.
Deciding right now. I'm busy with that.
Hi. Please clarify what to test terry in the BC?
I will decide today.
I hope so.
Oh, buddy, we keep getting new requirements. :-)
And so, it works perfectly.
Without VSS, it was ready to go to work yesterday!
hello
It's supposed to upload a crypto file to the web somewhere
and then download it from different machines with the chrome browser
and run it.
to make it work and knock.
Got it. I'll set it up.
Hi, how are you doing with the lockers?
Any requirements for the protocol, architecture, modes, additional requirements?
Dude, we built our own engine. It works great. AV is nothing. But, as soon as you try to manipulate VSS, it burns.
It's understandable. It's the mechanism against us.
Let's do it.
The main thing is to download from chrome
directly to the .exe file
so it doesn't get blocked.
I see. It's just that there is also a question of the host from where it is downloaded. There may also be some nuances.
Are there any complaints?
Crashes are an isolated incident.
Our task is clear.

Okay.
But this isn't a hospital.
What's...
I've looked a hundred times.
According to the website, it looks like a hospital.
They don't have ICU or anything like that.
They mostly treat sports injuries.
They're insured for 3 grand.
That's why they got busted.
They're well researched.
I don't do everything.
Okay
But we decided not to touch the health sector at all even like this, so let's avoid them now

what's up
hi.
There was a problem with the sia daemon hanging up. That is, it started up, and after a while it stops responding to RPC http requests. I think it was fixed by completely removing all files and renter data (contracts and other data). I recreated them, seems to be no longer hangs. I also need to fix the backup script, so that if I try to upload backup data to the server it would try to do it again.
In general, it is not very reliable yet. I had an idea to make two backup servers, so that one would be a backup and if I needed to erase everything I could restore from the second one.
So far, even the developers themselves believe that Sia is not suitable as the only place for backups.
I still have three servers in test mode on Sia.
I don't know what to do with Sia yet but I'll have it tomorrow.
can you provide security report while data is still uploading.

Sorry I got caught up.
Hi
Okay. .
How's it going with you?
Got in touch with golden yesterday.
I'll send him the crypto today.

hi.
There was a problem with the sia daemon hanging up. That is, it started, and after a while it stops responding to RPC http requests. I think it was fixed by completely deleting all the files and renter data (contracts and other data). I recreated them, seems to be no longer hangs. I also need to fix the backup script, so that if I try to upload backup data to the server it would try to do it again.
In general, it is not very reliable yet. I had an idea to make two backup servers, so that one would be a backup and if I needed to erase everything I could restore from the second one.
So far, even the developers themselves believe that Sia is not suitable as the only place for backups.
I still have three servers in test mode on Sia.

i need the rest of the money for the carbon the other day, i think they should send it over tomorrow...
It's out.
I am going to give them the rest, but they should send them the rest when they get the money ...
We talked to Veron, everything's done on my end, he's fine-tuning a bit more and that's it.
That's it for this set.
He'll give me more servers tomorrow.
Hey, for ramon, i made an account in group 6 grand

They -- I mean, the developers? The Skynet theme is being actively promoted right now. Developers are concentrating on it now. Network capacity is growing little by little -- about 3000 terabytes of free space available now, of which about 900 is used.
Run some private messages, it's weird how Psi+ crashes with the new fingerprint. Just checking.
So, things are developing little by little. Although in some places, technology is still raw. There is a possibility of data loss. But in my opinion, among similar technologies, the developers of Sia are the most advanced. And the system requirements are the lowest among competitors.
Adam asked me about it today -- I think he can tell you what he said.

Hi. Tom-y wrote off the files to check the three sent. There are nuances. When you start the smartscreen window pops up with a request to confirm the launch of an unknown eche. Plus Chrome still does not give a direct link to download the exe (eg site.net/file.exe).  From third-party exchangers download, tom checked. Well, he himself otpishete, I think. This links for today: privnote.com/qnWwYXQQ#3TLtk0rXt
2+2+3=?
At the expense of smartscreen with a warning so far, the opinion is that he will still pop up when you run the eche directly downloaded

Yes, I have already discussed maybe not an exe but some js file or something else.

I have someone who does
They created their own cryptocurrencies.

I need some ideas and full understanding.
bro come on

In general, the situation is this. about the salary for the team prof. Whom we bring him - I or Virep - they pay the salary we. Who they find themselves - they pay themselves. There starts the bullshit that they themselves do not understand who they pay who do not ... I wrote to Prof. Maybe you and C clarify who ends up paying who, etc.. He said ok and silence. Just in all our chats have people who pay us and the prof, even the reverses. I propose that there was no confusion and no one there accidentally by 2 times did not stick (was last time a couple of attempts, but I prieketsya))) - We need to decide Either I pay everyone the salary, or let the chat with pentesters where prof - they themselves pay everyone.

hello yes
ok
I'll talk to Reverse today.
I need a list of people.
All of them or just reversa?
We have a smaller concept of data analysis and call blackmail. I've put it to Booze:

We have a separate rocket for intelligence. there is a group on requests - there hackers ask to pressure or prepare this or that company. we pass it on to analysts, they make a report-dossier. if blackmail/calls are required - we pass this task to callers. So that the callers work efficiently and don't call up into the air like they do now - they are in touch with analysts and can ask them for any additional data
like a portion of the date listing, or some info on the computers/passwords.
If the company does not go into contact - its data is passed on, for publication on the site. (for this you need to pull up either the solver or some of his support team in this chat)

The essence of the problem with calls is that more often than not, when you call the reception, you get to some lady who does not know the situation. and in fact we just you out of nowhere with such a call, you need some kind of proof that there was a result, and not just hang up or send the caller.

Basically everything already works, we just need to fine-tune it and let the hackers start using it. I pulled up there gang dereke, hors, still pull up revers...
Today I'll prepare the actual lists of salaries and amounts, but it would be good if today you decided everything on the people of reversa
and i need money back too, both for salaries and carbon) and bonuses and bonuses
enough for sq8)))
I need two more days on the social network and i need to roll out my thoughts, my imagination ran wild while i was thinking about it all over the weekend with chivas, i'll formulate everything and write out a plan tonight. so far i'm loaded to my wits' end...
Hey. Any ideological leaders? Have you chosen a language? I looked up blockchain building, there are a lot of options in basic languages c++,c#, python, golang, javascript etc.

Hi
how'd it go
did you get zeus up and running?
hi again.
Hey, yeah.
He's been assigned an admin room.
The others to the third.
a browser for him and that one?
by the way, is tunry out of commission? he's been gone for a while
Hey ok
Hey, is there 50k for the reverser?
For the test mission.
Hi. Yeah. He did the job with a bang. But I can't get him on staff.
Why ?
I don't know what's wrong with him.
Okay, should I give the browser to Zeus and him?
He's a little slow on the uptake. He's lacking experience and imagination.
not yet.
they don't ask him.
ok
maybe in a couple of months he'll learn and write.
but is there a point?
Why not?

Repeat it, please. It's all cut up.
On the Prof - I talked to him, he said that you yourself decide everything and tell me what to do, neither from you nor from him in the end did not have any information...

Bro if you can please pay a little more attention - I'm trying to work on all your wants, and you read through a line like everything... Even now I threw you this type of git@ I wrote that he has a development on the social network, on bitcoin mixer, and you with him for the blockchain in the end talked. I understand that the social network will be on the blockchain, but the development of the social network also needs coders - so he has them. And what about the blockchain part - for it we will look for other people... so you ended up talking to him for the wrong reasons, or I do not understand something wrong in the tasks that you set

I fuck around here day and night on all fronts that you put, I want you to be there all the time, I constantly show initiative, but you end up answering once a day at best.

And as for pulling someone close - well, yes pulled, through the brother found the right people to solve your problem. No one will do that for you online. And offline, I do not think that you'll find the same badass guys who agree to risk a normal white firm with a hefty turnover and reputation, and even more than one in the end... To buy this carbon was a matter of principle already, and I could not find any other options with whom it could be done, and no one else would have found it, this is not a coke on the hydra to buy there own security service works like in the white house. It was just such a fucking difficult task, and in the end we got it done, we bought it. I also promised the guys that I would give them chicks and a sauna, because it was really not that easy. The same thing about Alka - you set the task to solve her problem. I'm working my butt off to solve it, thanks to the fact that I have good opportunities in this area - but then again, it's all offline, through a trusted person in whom I am 100% sure. And I understand my personal risks as well. But I'm doing your request as for me. In general, all these very extravagant quests you try to solve. I worry about the results of the whole team as for my own. I get upset when negative things come flying at you and try to fix it all, fix it all up. I save your money as my own, demand reports from all, bargain with all, collect sanctions if anyone has them... For all financial matters, everything is always clear and a few times I write you back, that where and how much was spent, why and why. But I have a clear feeling that you are not interested in this at all. I am not a psychic. I can't think for you about your cunning plan and all your desires. Then write down your tasks more precisely. I wrote about off-line, that I'll do through friends - all the time I wrote it. You didn't say a word. And now you say that you can not. We also talked about the budget of all these moves more than once - you wrote that OK, 50 60k is fine for you... And then it turns out that you don't even need it anymore.  I wrote that we have people who we have not considered before - I know that you do not have time for this, I decide myself with them so as not to bother you and not to ask for another 3-5k, you all write off and describe, where and what was spent - and you do not even remember about it.
You constantly make me think that you're not interested in what's going on here, that no matter how hard I try for you, I bring results - and you do not remember after 2 days about it ... "Later, tomorrow, yes, OK" It's all a trifle to you, but I've lived my whole life here while I've organized and arranged all this. I'll be gray in a year.

Skintosh when you get in.
The email services you asked for.

The tuta.io - it is the same tutanota mail registers tor, but also for activation of mail up to 48 hours are necessary, mass reguire mail so stop. So the option is normal, but it is necessary to register an account just for 2 days and everything will be clear

protonmail.com - asks for another email to register, but does not require confirmation! a normal option for your needs

nibblefish.net - all clear and without unnecessary questions, there are options web mail and pop3smtp, also a normal option

inbox.lv - sometimes it is slow through tor, but with a normal browser + vpn registers without problems

mail.rambler.ru - all clearly registered, if not confused that it ru (which is probably in fact even +)
still need ideas and a full understanding

hi
I mean, how to make your own blockchain?
That's a deep code to dig into.
Or do I need to raise Ethereum blockchain server and add to it some engine for wallet, exchange, and exchanger? I.e. do I need to raise some kind of infrastructure on one of the three blockchains listed above, or do I need to make a fork of one of them and sharpen it for myself? That is, what exactly is needed, and what should be part of this infrastructure?
Honestly, I have no idea about NFT, DEFI, DEX and how they differ. I know only about some types of tokens. I've only been on the blockchain topic for the last 2 years. I'm afraid that in a week I'll only understand very superficially.

Skintosh when you get in.
The email services you asked for.

The tuta.io - it is the same tutanota mail registers tor, but also for the activation of the mail up to 48 hours are needed, the mass reggae mail so stop. So the option is normal, but it is necessary to register an account just for 2 days and everything will be clear

protonmail.com - asks for another email to register, but does not require confirmation! a normal option for your needs

nibblefish.net - all clear and without unnecessary questions, there are options web mail and pop3smtp, also a normal option

inbox.lv - sometimes it is slow through tor, but with a normal browser + vpn registers without problems

mail.rambler.ru - all clearly registrated, if not confused that it ru (which is probably in fact even +)
hi
I mean, how do I make my own blockchain?
It's deep in the code.
Or I should build Ethereum blockchain server and add to it some engine for wallet, exchange, exchanger? I.e. do I need to raise some kind of infrastructure on one of the three blockchains listed above, or do I need to make a fork of one of them and sharpen it for myself? That is, what exactly is needed, and what should be part of this infrastructure?
Honestly, I have no idea about NFT, DEFI, DEX and how they differ. I know only about some types of tokens. I've only been on the blockchain topic for the last 2 years. I'm afraid that in a week I'll only get a very superficial understanding.

I regal mail there, and the next day I come in and he does not go to me already and in 2-3 days, too. Just deleted the mail

Hi. I wrote to him a couple of times about the files, I sent him links to files, but he did not answer.

Yeah, I need you to check the files before sending them out.
Write to him and mango.

0.02459216 BTC, 3Jc3mTyYuRpP7hynPaStpDBPNd8FYydzS
Where did you get such an amount
I thought you only have 1k a month.
ready to go
i copied the wrong one. the new admins were just writing a minitka.
Who has ideas on blockchain? and cryptocurrencies, where to go and what to develop. Who considers themselves gurus in crypto trends?
1) we want to create our own crypto system along the lines of:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. That on our system others already created their coins, exchanges and projects.
that's right my $500 0.01745231 bc1qzgmx2k26pqcce03qff73c2j7072qp46zku4uuu6
tell me all newbies to ask about wages to send you, because they write how to count, etc.....
yeah
gone
It's almost 600.
Thanks.
is this some kind of exchange?
Just a bts exchange for cash.
There's a shitload of fees.
Look for some other withdrawal options. 20% is fat.
[Error: the message is encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
I do not know, if you tell me where else you can easily exchange it for cash?
I don't know
Why don't you pay by card?
There's a 5-7 percent fee.
The unemployed have money on the card, that's why I was thinking about cash.
I may have to try another exchanger with cash sometime in the future
Hi
Are you working?
Hi. Let me give you some money.

Hey how are you?
You're the one I remember working or not working for four months.
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What challenges are you facing?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... What ideas anyone has.
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other people can build their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

hello
ghbdtn
hi
you're quite the news reader.)
They send it to me.)
i went through all the coders and updated the current projects
if you need anything, i'm up to date on everything :)
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
found an option to buy zuminfo account for 2 managers buse for reconnaissance price 2k
budget if you do not cheat of course, through a guarantor can be done
I remind you about the social network and a bunch more)
carbon there and so on.
:)
lf 2r
yeah 2k can be without a guarantor
on tom@ need to run it
from our side everything is ready a long time ago.
i can't get him to come to us. but sometimes i need him when our guys are on cleanup or can't get around it.
last 1k i gave him for balance
if his scheme doesn't work, get expensive certificates
order them
sign the backlog
you need to pay for test tasks, social network designer, I paid everything and put some money in advance to buy a modem, a security course...
...and then run it.
and i'd like my bits back and my carbon back...
and everyone probably got their paychecks and you don't even think about me)
let's get the bits back
How much do you remember, or should I write it all down again?
I don't remember, just tell me how much and that's it.
No need to sign off.
I do not remember how much, and that's it, no countersigning.
[28.06.2021 18:12:55] <mango> for the carbon I need to return 1.32 bitcoins at the rate on the day when I paid for it) and I also need to refund 12.5k for ST to new people from the last payment and the purchase of carbon itself dokidyl
and if you can send me the salary at once I will be very happy)
1.32 btz as of today at the rate of 44100 +12,500
56600
you can also send me a bonus so I have enough for C line :-D
i got the nets, i got the carbon, i got the social network, i got everyone's brains, i got everyone's brains
come on, just so I can work in the comfort of my own home.
you get a bonus from the people who sold you that carbon
which you don't need anymore
drop the coattails
We'll give them their money back, and let the carbon lying around, in case you need it later
I paid them back a long time ago
Yeah, I get it.
I'll pay you back.
It's like they waited a week, you left me no choice...
What's the difference?
And why don't you need it in the end?
No one to take care of it or what?
let's sell it, there's a demand for it
It's just that the crews wanted it.
They wanted to research it.
It took them a long time to make it
and then they gave it up
or made it themselves I don't know
Let's do our own research.
Well, in the end, we didn't bring it up with them.
I asked Prof.
if he wanted carbon
He said no, not yet.
Well, he could.
but no time
The bouza wants to explore on his own.
but he doesn't have a purpose why
you can give hors@
Talk to hors@.
send the cat.
let me and hors@ come up with something
about it.
I think he would be interested as they often have nets with carbon
What kind of social networking moves do you need?
on social networking.
We ended up wanting his goals and ideas so I don't make a big deal out of it.
I think it should be run with minimal functionality
well for now it's just a nice forum and closer to a social network
like this
balances, deposits theme people
message there , guarantor, etc
add Btz, ether and monero to accept payments
functionality in the course of the battle
not just btz

we need to understand how a social network should be
where is it selling something
where are the auctions etc.
So far, only deposits/payment between members? No exchange, etc.?
Maybe it could be merged with someone or something
maybe an exchanger or something
Think
I told you in my terms of reference what you can earn there
Let the designer draw it
you can make participants donate to each other for info/education
who drew the green
uh-huh
[14:52:19] <zevs@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> another question, send def on the archives, maybe we'll find something for trade, it's a good theme there profitable
all got it, build the framework, then we'll finish it
you there and did not give them the archive?
It's been a week.
even the bonus for zeus didn't motivate you
bc1qfamjhlyec63dz3gvcum7s9guu3cp5n8v3hz7ud
me 56600 + salary
give me bonuses for nets, containers, injectors, and other things in life)
on the s line so i'll be like a badass
1.32 is for carbon?
and it takes 3k to work
I won't give you anything for the windows
That's for the company they made the carbon for
because it's no use yet
Injectors too
I'm just saying)
I'm not tuning))))
at least get mine back)))))
I understand about the networks, your man is working with chors
I've been waiting three weeks.
we'll figure it out, is he still giving out nets?
yes
I'll get yours back.
bc1qfamjhlyec63dz3gvcum7s9guu3cp5n8v3hz7ud
here 1.32 ?
Yeah, but he's on vacation this week.
or how much
everything can be there
spaniard ?
Yeah, he'll be here on Mon.
Johnny's working too.
and a couple of other people in the process...
I gave vpns to reverse and there's silence.
I reminded him a couple of times, and now the guy who gave it is gone...
These tactics that kind of wait unneeded to drop out by themselves - bro I may not understand something here, but it seems to me that the drop out as a result of it just those who want to work right here and now ...
and those who just want to get paid will sit quietly and make minimal fuss...
in my opinion...
I don't understand anything...
but you understand it better than I do.
how to do it right.
No, I don't say that.)
I got 100 people here, half of them don't even do 10% of the work
and only ask for money because they think they're fucking useful
there's a guy named frog@ his nickname
He's a guy called frog@.
He didn't get paid for four months.
Then he knocked on the door.
He says I'm done with the tank.
Give me 4 months salary
I checked and really didn't take money
I asked him why didn't you write.
He says I wasn't satisfied with myself.
and there are those that you yourself do not understand why, but you say not to remove them.
when you're done, you write it down.
That's the kind of people we need
not those who ask for their salary every month and write
for example, the alky meeni os his lights and the drunken baguette
I have good crypts
Let him crypto.
the baguette will be clear in a month
he diavol finished the locker
♪ he's on the pro's test ♪
and his team
seems to be clean from av
baguette if you don't pay him he won't quit
he's asking for it but he won't quit
he won't drop out if you don't pay him for a year even
such a man
he's already stuck here.
He's handed in several projects.
It's just that I think a lot of people get complacent because you don't really ask, and then they always find ways to justify themselves
So the coder came in
they gave him 30k
before i brought up the fact that the styler isn't working properly and isn't looting - i was told everything was fine there
and told me to give me a clean loeder.
he gave me a looder after 3 weeks
until i poked it right there...
clean
the cleanest
we've had 16 people making lowers
for over a year.
there's no clean
and tl
etc.
well with bots like derek bro it's hard to keep it clean there i think
hey
If he's on the job he'll get caught quickly
It's the hands that matter.
You let me know.
I'm done with mine.
and when they're making 500 bots, 400 of them are Honeypots...
I need you to do some urgent work on the vault.
I didn't make any adjustments to the vault.
and i couldn't debug properly, i'm having trouble with the balls
i've just messed with the ingame module, everything was cleaned up, i asked for zevs to be attached - friday is the only day it was tested - and it was already burned during the test
Well, to check the write rights.
derek has one bk
and we have 5 or 6 of them
There is another point that almost all of them do not understand the full picture of how it works...
it's one thing for coders who have been working with Malware for a long time, but another thing is that our coders partially insert pieces of code and have never seen Troy before and they don't know how it should be and why
And those who know won't work for 2,000 rubles.
we're looking for new people on hack forums. the advert says 2k salary and there are lots of comments that we're recruiting slaves) we challenge that those who work and deliver results get more, etc... but examples show that coders who work well earn 5-10k... it's hard to make an agreement with them all
Juniors go for 2k...
there are only middlemen on hack forums
that's why they write there
in general, coders in russia for
intermediaries a shitload
from 60k rubles
up to 300k
for 300k to have a job, the coder should be very lucky
That's why I suggest that at the initial stage to create credibility and excitement, they should be allowed to work by sponsorship/voting.
google pays 300k in russia or microsoft pays top coders
firstly, it's purely for the geeks in the know, and the rest later, so they have a vested interest in joining us
like it was with thecc
thecc was shit
There's 10 cripples.
no action.
i got signed up there
i was there for a week
you must have seen it in the wrong days)
half a year later, I went back.
Nothing has changed.
it's the coolest forum in terms of people
thehack is English speaking
and verified
russian
there was a good movement towards the end when a fly became an admin, people tried to get there 2 or 3 times, he just started to organize moves, but unfortunately he was accepted and everything stopped abruptly
verfied was dumped in the spring
There should be at least 1 million people on social networks.
They have now recovered, apologized, and continue to work as if nothing had happened.
All the forums.
Look, why don't we do this as a white project?

That's fine.
Just with a footnote that we're not responsible for what goes on there.
It is a white project.
just a backdoor move.
)))
everyone will be there.
reporters
ordinary users
buyers

We need to get all the stores in one place.
to pay them there
and their percentage.
to order 20 percent.
I'm thinking, by the way, to move to Moscow and try to open a firm there on the PC, this plan has long been hatched ... to recruit first system field engineers, then pull a couple of designers / copywriters - advertising, and to pull cm, and as the staff is formed - you can take on outsourcing companies what things. it is clear that there is not much money, but 1 can gradually pick up the right people under 2 can rediably some gray themes do, such as a carbon-based
Well, you want to like on OZONE was like, site where virtual tenants offer products / services
specialize specifically on hackers and carders that is not going to?
In essence, this does not change anything. vichat in darknet, and that's all,
large forum with a convenient way to communicate and additional functionality. at the initial stage - what competitors have, advertising, deposits, etc., etc.
You need an idea and a gimmick to attract people not just to register once and forget about it, but to make them want to come back and hang out there all the time.
I have come up with all sorts of functional there and you do not appreciate it)))
not a good idea

10 years ago we should have
do
now it's better to run it from a laptop
no firms
and you need to hire people who understand and understand blockchain
there's all the dough
[15:14:05] <mango> you want it to be like on OZONE, a site where virtual tenants offer goods/services
[15:14:18] <mango> we won't specialize on hackers and carders?
yes
like hydra only for stolen data
plus forum
in different languages
forum is not the main topic
Trading is the main thing.
communication is second.
plus news
and discussions and so on.
We'll do that later.
Maybe we'll do a casino.
Same place.
Hi.
I'll be in touch.
What do you need done?

[15:16:21] <mango> I have invented so many things for this functionality there and you do not appreciate it somehow I think)))


The only thing I've appreciated so far is paying my employees their salaries (great, you got me off the hook) and the second thing is that you kind of matched it up with the horses.
Did you figure out how to pull the data from the storage?
I need two txt files from each admin room
to pull the data from each admin.
Country
Bot ID
link: etrade.com
login
pass
two txts are needed
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
per admin.
download all the accounts.
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
now and upload it to me in a zip archive with the password at sendspace.com.
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
Look, I don't care. You say what you need, I do it. I just wish it wasn't for nothing.
in the zipped archive again there should be two tht's. each tht's is an admin. and the pikes go all the way down
and i'm trying to make it all fancy.
I've been trying to get my imagination on a certain link to etrade.com.
and you don't even read it.
You say I want this and that.
You have to download from Browser Access.
Don't download without a password, only if you have a username and password.
but i've got it all figured out - you just haven't read it or gone into it
you say you need someone with an idea - i'm a better person than you) i'm into all this and do it for myself, but there are moments when you and your attention is indispensable
i asked you to decide if it's a social network, centralized or not, open source or not
In fact, you need acesses with login-password for a specific link etrade.com?
Download by both admins and drop via sendspace.com
is that correct?
and you don't even remember .
centralized
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]

There's no connection to the tournament, by the way?
he's got the importdll module, he's got a super browser on him, I wish I could at least get the source code, he hasn't shown up for months.
importDll is similar to bill@
he did it
all these modules - you're saying that we need the adversaries - but damn bro they won't go if we don't have anything to offer them... That's why as long as the trike is our website it has to be the benchmark.
♪ and tunny's sources are at def's git ♪
he only cleaned
the source of the import is, there is no source of the superbrowser
the bank theme is dead.
i don't know what else you want to squeeze out)
even the researchers are fucked up.
you're adding an injector to the trike)
the new adverts all work on the injector
everyone's surprised!)
and by the way, everything's pouring out, bro.
come on, let's see.
i don't talk to anyone - everyone is pouring. it's complicated but it all works
who's pouring?
aZ I had before - now the type loads 3-4k bots a week, pours on 100 150k a week
Zeus is a new guy - they also work for US by token.
YS is good in general, but you need to know the themes there
as far as i understand, they work with Cookies + login passwords
and the stuff goes too ... it's all small and we are not interested I understand it all
but it's interesting to the adversaries, they'll maximize the profits of their loyads
[15:31:13] <mango> aZ that I had before - now type loads 3-4k bots a week, pours 100 150k a week


Take his corps.
i'm sure he'll make more than 100-150k a week with us
for 3-4k bots.
they're ready. i offered them a job on the trike.
they said that trike is a dirty shit no one supports))))
i tried my best to justify myself but it was hard to argue))))
it was like that for a while, now hof has cleaned it up for zeus
give him a bk.
but trike has a worm.
he can turn 3k bots into 10k bots
there's something wrong with the imported dll, some of it was fixed, but some of the problems remain. plus the injector didn't work right, plus the styler isn't robbing everything) in short, there's something to fuck with
and the most important thing everyone wants is a vntz normal
and reproduction is debatable if you're working on the Injams, because when you reproduce bots immediately subnets fall off... and as far as I understood the bots from the reproduction does not go to their admin office and in some ...
they have their moments everywhere, but now they are working on it, in a month or two everything will be fine.
I'll be gone for a couple of hours, don't forget to send me some beats.

1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So that others already created their coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

The bots from breeding will go to them
Yeah, got it.
do you have any idea how the repository works?
I downloaded 1.32
What else do you need?
Hi
who do you upload hash@ bots to?
Hi, there were no bots. I gave one big bot to reverse, but they could not jump
But if it's 10k or so, then it's to Horses.
Bobi not yet discounted, because there is nothing. I try to divide it between Horses and Bobi
Have you ever had anything over 10k?
Yes there were a couple, but there either could not jump or off went corp
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Yes
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
19 total there, over 10kk was 5pc, 3 off, in the other 2 couldn't jump
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
He says there were 500-600 bots
Yeah) I wish. There's still glitchy admin, I can not tell how many with vg, but 500-600 there was definitely not. Maximum 100 with the Vg, and that's unlikely.
There alone avs. 14760, and 19 corps - all.
For bots in general now is bad. In general, do not go. Tomorrow will try bk with balzac.
Here's the deal.
In general, I found the code which is responsible for unloading, judging by everything it was ground up a little bit on a different format. There reference type rackspace and format brief.
I managed to upload in link:login:pass format. Setting format, that you're asking there is also, but I have not been able to do it yet.
In this regard, 3 questions.
1. How critical will it be if I complete this upload tomorrow?
2. does it have to be an exact link match or should yurls like app.servisetrade.com also be in the sample?
Bot Id, is it its datatype like 971BB5287788095B1DBBCCA9B8CA3BB2 or internal ID in the admin like 156789678?
I can give you access to see for yourself.
He looks at the stats just where the imports more than 22
Av has one too, that's why I said so much!

Uh, now if only a fork of some blockchain is done, it could take years to create from scratch. The basic trilem of blockchains: speed of transactions, security and scalability.
For example, a full ether node cannot be deployed on most computers, there is not enough space. The network commission sometimes goes overboard and the network becomes inefficient.

Hi.
Good to hear.

We have a problem like this. We have a mac os and a backdoor for mac. It is able to run python scripts and bash scripts. The client is asking for a tool to go around the networks. Can you help?

Hello!
Hello
о
please tell me the following
My specs for the loader say that it should be able to work through a proxy-server
you can write a proxy server on the server?
what server?
I don't know?
It's written in the ToR. I am puzzled, and my team leader avoids talking, said - must test to the administrator, they will prescribe a proxy server
apparently this must be written on the test machines
as far as the runtime is concerned, the admin has nothing to do with the loader
send me your terms of reference
I'll just copy the phrase, there's one sentence
on this subject

The loader should support operation through a proxy, if it is specified in the settings of the operating system (inetcpl.cpl -> Connection -> Proxy settings).
Apparently, it is assumed that the loader enters the system, where the output to the Internet is through a proxy server, and should not get confused. But how?
you can't give me a name of a prog with a loader, so i can address them on this topic?

Hi. Love is asking me to disable vntz functionality if the bot is reserved. And how do you do the reservation now7.
So now you get to look at the update rate of domains and disable vnts for others if the bot is reserved by someone, right7
Anything else, or no more tasks yet?

<salamandra> can you tell me how to deal with new admins? i find them via e-mail i send to greene and he checks and says they fit. i then write to him to get them into the system and then send them to the projects that need it. In the end, even those who were interviewed and came to us are sitting and no one writes them anything. i don't know who is in juey because they communicate with grin in juey. and as a result, they hang up and no one informs me anything. it feels like i work idle. somehow, this point should be adjusted
[03:00:50] <salamandra> because stern will ask me where the people are. and i'll tell him ask greene

Hi.
Ok, I was wondering what I could do, I'll probably try copying the supervisor configs from dnog to auction
I'm here, I'll look into it now
Hey, .
Did you see the messages?
Yes
About the grabber thing.
I'll have to look into it.
What about the configs?
Well, Love says it's slowing down.
It's slowing down. You say the bots are empty.
Everything works fine on dnog.
In theory, if I copy the configs for the supervisor from there should work like on dnog.
That's if I try quickly.
Or I could still try to figure out why this is happening.
And then that would take time.
And with the grabber, I'll figure it out. I'm on it.
Try replacing the config.
Just save this one to roll it back.
Yeah, that's understandable.

Hi
Some of the ransomware operations using this botnet for network access include the infamous Ryuk, Conti, REvil, as well as a new one called Diavol, the Romanian for Devil.

Since Emotet's takedown by law enforcement, Trickbot activity started to increase to such levels that in May it was the most prevalent malware on Check Point's radar.

The malware maintained its position this month, too, the cybersecurity company notes in a report today, adding that Trickbot's maintainers are constantly working to improve it.

According to Check Point's telemetry, Trickbot impacted 7% of organizations across the world, followed by the XMRig cryptocurrency miner the Formbook info stealer, which affected 3% of the organizations that Check Point monitors worldwide.
New VNC module in the works

In another report, Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender says that its systems caught a new version of Trickbot's VNC module (vncDLL), used after compromising high-profile targets.

The updated module is called tvncDLL and allows the threat actor to monitor the victim and collect information that would enable pivoting to valuable systems on the network.

Although tvncDLL was discovered on May 12, the Romanian researchers say that it is still under development, "since the group has a frequent update schedule, regularly adding new functionalities and bug fixes."

Bitdefender's analysis of the module points out that it uses a custom communication protocol and reaches the command and control (C2) server through one of nine proxy IP addresses that enable access to victims behind firewalls.

Trickbot's tvncDLL module attack overview

The VNC component can stop Trickbot and unload it from memory. When an operator initiates communication, the module creates a virtual desktop with a custom interface.

"During normal operation, the alternate desktop is created and fully controlled by the module, copying the icons from the desktop, creating a custom taskbar for managing its processes and creating a custom right-click menu, containing custom functionality," Bitdefender researchers write in their report.

Right click menu for Trickbot's tvncDLL

Using the command prompt, the threat actor can download fresh payloads from the C2 server, open documents and the email inbox, steal data from the compromised system.

Another option called Native Browser fires up a web browser by taking advantage of the OLE automation feature in Internet Explorer.

The function is under development and its purpose is to steal passwords from Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

Trickbot's tvncDLL Native Browser feature

The researchers say that while the old vncDLL module has been in use since at least 2018, its successor became active in the wild on May 11, 2021, according to evidence revealed during their investigation.

Telemetry data from Bitdefender data shows Trickbot's C2 servers spread on almost all continents, with the largest number (54) located in North America. According to the company, the number of C2 servers has increased significantly this year, jumping from around 40 in January to more than 140 in June.

Please correct the data (fill in the form), otherwise we will have to lower your rating from the first day of the next month.
This will affect your credit card limits, mortgage costs, etc., and may also cause your insurance payments to increase.

Some of the ransomware operations using this botnet for network access include the infamous Ryuk, Conti, REvil, as well as as a new one called Diavol, the Romanian for Devil.

Since Emotet's takedown by law enforcement, Trickbot activity started to increase to such levels that in May it was the most prevalent malware on Check Point's radar.

The malware maintained its position this month, too, the cybersecurity company notes in a report today, adding that Trickbot's maintainers are constantly working to improve it.

According to Check Point's telemetry, Trickbot impacted 7% of organizations across the world, followed by the XMRig cryptocurrency miner the Formbook info stealer, which affected 3% of the organizations that Check Point monitors worldwide.
New VNC module in the works

In another report, Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender says that its systems caught a new version of Trickbot's VNC module (vncDLL), used after compromising high-profile targets.

The updated module is called tvncDLL and allows the threat actor to monitor the victim and collect information that would enable pivoting to valuable systems on the network.

Although tvncDLL was discovered on May 12, the Romanian researchers say that it is still under development, "since the group has a frequent update schedule, regularly adding new functionalities and bug fixes."

Bitdefender's analysis of the module points out that it uses a custom communication protocol and reaches the command and control (C2) server through one of nine proxy IP addresses that enable access to victims behind firewalls.

Trickbot's tvncDLL module attack overview

The VNC component can stop Trickbot and unload it from memory. When an operator initiates communication, the module creates a virtual desktop with a custom interface.

"During normal operation, the alternate desktop is created and fully controlled by the module, copying the icons from the desktop, creating a custom taskbar for managing its processes and creating a custom right-click menu, containing custom functionality," Bitdefender researchers write in their report.

Using the command prompt, the threat actor can download fresh payloads from the C2 server, open documents and the email inbox, steal data from the compromised system.

Another option called Native Browser fires up a web browser by taking advantage of the OLE automation feature in Internet Explorer.

The function is under development and its purpose is to steal passwords from Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

The researchers say that while the old vncDLL module has been in use since at least 2018, its successor became active in the wild on May 11, 2021, according to evidence revealed during their investigation.

Telemetry data from Bitdefender data shows Trickbot's C2 servers spread on almost all continents, with the largest number (54) located in North America. According to the company, the number of C2 servers has increased significantly this year, jumping from around 40 in January to more than 140 in June.
