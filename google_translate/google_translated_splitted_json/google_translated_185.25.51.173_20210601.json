Limiting the time frame xs of course how, 2 weeks is quite acceptable, as many take loans, etc. .. I think that we need to analyze and nightmare more deeply by merging something that is dear to them, and not everything in a row, plus we need to push harder, annoy with calls, ddos partners, cover it in the media .. I propose to organize the work in such a way that by the time of the lock we have a complete analysis report: top management, contacts, their personal data, what we will find, partners, their contacts, and most importantly, a strategy is calculated on how to press, what is acceptable for what targets. We wrinkle boobs, bargain like schoolchildren, gangsters don’t behave like that, all these concessions are useless, I didn’t expect this from you even somehow :-D We just need to set ransoms more realistically from the beginning and stand firm. And we start with a lyama and agree to 100k. Taking into account the fact that the FBI is sitting there monitoring all these negotiations, I think they are mocking us. It’s not just that they drag out all these negotiations, they study us, wallets, etc. Maybe a big leak is some kind of loud or something else that will attract attention, it can even make locks and drains without ransoms at all - an exemplary flogging supposedly) Throw 30 50 100 companies there - throw out all the data we can get .. maybe not even large ones, but so that it was heard, so that everyone else would tense up and think less .. And change the color of the admin panel, we are a locker, not tiffany :-D"}]
