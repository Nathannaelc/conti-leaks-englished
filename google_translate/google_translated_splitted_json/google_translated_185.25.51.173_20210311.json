Your task and other interested parties is to give me access, code, servers and everything I need to work effectively, I don’t think that everything is perfect with this, so the responsibility here is yours. I believe that the situation when I cannot quickly resolve the issue is normal, given the conditions in which I find myself.

I think it&#39;s my responsibility to figure it out and solve problems, and I, by virtue of my ability and speed, believe that I can cope with this. Your task and other interested parties is to give me access, code, servers and everything I need to work effectively, I don’t think that everything is perfect with this, so the responsibility here is yours. I believe that the situation when I cannot quickly resolve the issue is normal, given the conditions in which I find myself. I&#39;m not Mav, I&#39;m a different person, I try to do my job and put in enough effort.
