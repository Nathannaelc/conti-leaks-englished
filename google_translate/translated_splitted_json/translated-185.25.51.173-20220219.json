Looked at monero. Yes, it is the only blockchain that cares a lot about anonymity. They say it right in the docs. The principle is clear, I approximately and represented.

The Exonum framework was created specifically for the development of private blockchains. This is a system in which only a predefined group of nodes (those same validators) can create new blocks in the blockchain. This one is written in Rust. I looked at their Github. It can be seen that they are accompanying, a month ago there were some changes. Not abandoned. We must already do something. I feel like a bum to myself. Reading, reading...
