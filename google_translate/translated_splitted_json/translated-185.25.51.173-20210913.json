By injection under VNC: The problem of not loading some sites, or loading in the wrong form, associated with inserting our code into html. As a result of the work, a lot of ssl certificates and a cache are created, while some of them are updated, and some are not. At the same time, the criteria for such behavior are unknown, which leads to difficulties in recreating the problem situation on the test machine. As a result, if Chrome has not updated the cache, our certificate does not suit it, some of the pieces are taken normally, some are not, a conflict occurs, resulting in a page break. This needs to be checked with the config encoder. Even today, Jaime has assembled an assembly to combat the privacy error, Robin will throw off the addresses that need to be checked. Otherwise, no big changes so far.
