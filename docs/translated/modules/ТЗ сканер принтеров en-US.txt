PRINTER VULNERABILITY SCANNER
TERMS OF REFERENCE


PURPOSE
We need a scanner of vulnerable printers open for access from the Internet.
The result of the scanner is a list of addresses where there is a printer with a confirmed vulnerability.


ALGORITHM
Scanner combines two public services: https://shodan.io and Printer Exploitation Toolkit https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET
- At shodan.io we search, for example, for the word PJL
- Parsing results and feeding them to the PRET script
- If PRET script can connect to the printer, execute commands like this
 id
 pwd
 ls
 df
and write the command itself and its result to the log
- move on to the next search result.

Note: you need an account to access shodan.io. But by idea it is safe even when implemented as a bot module.
You can prefetch the necessary data in .csv format and load them separately into bots via configs.
Exporting search results in .csv/.json from shodan.io is a paid service.

REALIZATION
There are two options for implementation:
* as a standalone scanner.
  + Any scripting language, but not too exotic (python, PowerShell, javascript).
  + Quick and easy.
* As a module for the bot.
  + Implementation takes much longer because you need to rewrite PRET on C++
  + but you can work in a distributed way
