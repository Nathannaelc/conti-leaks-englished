SuperBrowser v.0.70

Description:
---------
The software is designed to simulate working in a browser using someone else's fingerprints.
To do this:
- The grabber module collects browser profiles (cookies, locale, timezone, etc.)
- The superbrowser allows to use these fingerprints to work under the guise of this user.


Settings for working with the program:
----------------------------------
To get started you need to:
- go through the procedure of activating your machine to work with SuperBrowser!!!
- installed TOR Browser
- SuperBrowser folder with the following contents:
	contains 21 files. Important for use, are:
	- launcher.exe - to launch the browser on new operating systems
	- launch_win7.cmd - for launching the browser on older operating systems
	- cache - cache profiles
	- profiles-profiles for each config (a new one is created after each launch of the browser)
	- confs - configs from the built machine (appears in the folder when you start the browser from the admin area)
- account in bot admin
- account in the storage admin

Connect the superbrowser as a "mail agent" to the Tor Browser:
1.Open the Tor Browser.
	- Enter about:config
	- Search for network.protocol-handler.external.mailto
	- Set it to true
Otherwise mailto will not work correctly.
2.Next you need to prescribe the path to launcher.exe (located in sbrowser folder) to your Tor browser, where you open the storefront admin):
	- Go to the Tor menu: Setting (Options) -> General -> Applications -> option mailto
	- Enter the path to our browser (the field to the right of mailto):
          On old OS (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows XP with SP3, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003) we write launch_win7.cmd
          On new operating systems, just point to launcher.exe
          (Otherwise Mozilla Firefox will work poorly. This is due to bugs in Windows and Firefox).

* This is done on a one-time basis.

This hack is used to run our software by clicking on special links in the admin panel.

Usage:
--------------
1. We take a working bot in the bot admin.
2. Copy the machine id (field Prefix + Client)
3. Enter admin panel of the repository. Find bot by its id.
4. Click on the link of the found machine.
In the window of data you see the following line: Grabber: Chrome Firefox IE Edge Start. Press Start
(this launches a command, which goes to the bot, so that the module is loaded/started there).
When the collection is done, numbers like: Chrome16-6 Firefox IE:16-6 will appear (it's possible that the numbers won't appear for a long time, but the collection is done. It depends on storage load)
5. Click on the icon of the desired browser.
If the settings of the prescribed path to launcher.exe (SuperBrowser) are correct, launcher.exe will launch with the profile of the desired browser.
* In this way the grabbed profile is loaded from the storage to superbrowser.

In the launched Launcher:
- At the top left there is a box to select the browser profile, like: Chrome as Jim(FISHPC).
- In the Values tab in the parameters there is a line conf.userchrome:
		- If you set it to false or leave it empty, then after you press run browser will mimic Mozilla Firefox
		- If you set it to true, it will mimic Chrome (if you get an error, ignore it)
- leave the other parameters untouched.
* You can check for cookies in Cookies tab.
6. Press Run Browser (this will create a profile and start the browser).
7. Check the browser links.

Optional:
When checking socks through SuperBrowser, it is possible to insert socks, in the appropriate field. The field is at the top right under the name "Socks (no proxy)".



Possible browser startup errors and how to fix them:
---------------------------------------------------
1. error 213 - can be solved by disabling flash cookies:
			  1. there is FlahLso tab in launcher.exe window - right click - disable all (or uncheck all boxes).
2. Error 181 - can be solved: 1. delete contents of cache folder (the path sbrowser --> cache).
			  2. delete contents of profiles folder (path sbrowser --> profiles).
			  3. restart SuperBrowser.
3. Could not AssignProcessToObject - appears when starting SuperBrowser on old operating systems marked below - you need to write path to launch_win7.cmd (look in Tor settings).
