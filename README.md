Google translated conti leaks, which is shared by a member of the conti ransomware group.

Here is the tweet this was shared: https://twitter.com/ContiLeaks/status/1498030708736073734

Some strings are not properly translated by google so I will upload the original splitted pdfs too if you want to translate them with a better translater or with a better format.
