Hi
Let's get the dollar out of the game.
He's a fucking moron.
He fucked me up the other day, he made a deal with you to fuck up the hospital.
And now he's putting the hospital back on.
That's disrespectful.
Two times I told him we don't touch the medical sector.
He gave out the salaries all right.
A lot of people have already dropped out.

you're fucking with the horse percentages, you're throwing the poor guy, you're spinning some kind of intrigue
you're really more trouble than you're worth.
You are a pain in the ass.
your hospitals are sick and tired of you
you are the brainchild of your conti and it is unclear why, what do you and conti)))))) have to do with it? I showed it to Stern myself this morning, so I do not know what you're going to decide with me
I think there's nothing to solve, if you're allowed to do that, if you're constantly complaining and harassed then why the fuck do we need to ruin our reputation after your shenanigans
5% for negotiations, 20% for expenses and organization - for what? Don't you think it's funny?
We don't have such percentages for anyone. If you want to work - work normally, we're all in the same boat.
And you can tell Derek that I don't give a fuck about your moods, I don't need it to make excuses for you all the time
So, did you manage to put any more today?

shorter trampich, I do not know coincidence or not, but here are the thoughts I had when analyzing the situation this whole situation with the servers: amerikas agrees to the figure of 4.5k somehow easily and thus asks a lot of fucking time allegedly to get the money. in this period we just start having problems with the servers, glitched for several days, and tonight I understand they disappeared and appear these faggots and ask to send them 4 fucking files for fuck knows some legal bullshit. Don't you think that's too weird a coincidence?
When the guys downloaded the date, couldn't they have left a trace of IP addresses somewhere?
Maybe the bitches figured it out somewhere and got to the DC?
If there was an accident with the server, both servers would be lost at once, and so one is gone, and the second was available, but the password knows who the fuck changed, and then he disappeared. well, I think our servers have not returned as the date
Write back please, what do you think about the situation as a whole? maybe you need to fucking clean up everything, and the laptop into the oven?)
Hey, it's Kagas. Did you get it?

Everything will be okay.
We need it fast.
Did america see what she wrote?
They're waiting for the files.
Last kind of check for the lawyer.
Yeah, we can get rid of that if anything.
It's bullshit of course, but if you get the ftp back it would be really good
I don't think so, and we can't upload shit, we don't have a date.
that's why we need ftp
so what did the DC support wrote?

Got it
It turns out such a beautiful story with him.  Remember when I came back from vacation in the summer, I wrote you in September that Horse was sulking and not answering. Ed@ took advantage of that. He sat on my ear, why do you need Horses, come to us, we have great conditions! We have swept a lot of nets since November, more than 10.  In the chat room, he gave us access only in December. He said that he would give us access as soon as somebody would come.   And chats of course was not. And as practice has shown, with the last grid with which he did not pay extra. He communicated by mail.  So there is reason to doubt the others. But I'm already dak id not get it he banned me and all my team in his chat.
The moral is that he introduced us and put himself on a par with you. That it's his baby and stuff. And when we met, I told you the story of how we were cheated by a pirate and you told me that working with you this will never happen again.
I don't have a problem with you. I'm really looking forward to you.  I just need a little help from you.
But now not only have we made peace with chorus, but i've taken reverse. Fuck it. I got two more. And I'm waiting for new ones.
Brother, here's another question. Who keeps tabs on the chats? I just don't go in. The two we did the other day.

Hi
He hasn't texted me anything

He told me to solve his problem and get him to work.
we must have different sterns
and it's been a long time since stern)
as for the cyber bro i'll decide who gets what and who doesn't, it's certainly not up to you
i don't have a personal problem with you guys
I don't need to tell anyone anything on behalf of the conti, moreover, don't bullshit me about security, what you do and how you fool someone is your business, but not on behalf of the conti and the team as a whole, we have no cheats and will not, the boss made it clear to all and made it clear.
Could I have gotten my salary today?
Fucking day today instead of solving the issue with the servers
Trampych, what's up with the DC, americas is on fire, it's fucking pathetic
let's try to resuscitate, tell us what we need to do
Yeah. .
I'm aware of that.
let's see.

Hey

Hi
Not yet.
Eh!
Yeah.
I'm aware of that.
We'll see about that.
I slept all day.
we had a big taget at night until 7:00 a.m.
Taget is cool, send me the setup info on it.
But I don't want to lose 4.5k either.
Especially since they're giving them away.
only need 4 files to give them
SNACKINTERNAL - what kind of company is this?
That's the fuckin' company all the money went to today.
so send me the setup
I'll make a blog
Where the fuck did you disappear to again?

Looks like they took away the server and the date.
I haven't heard from him at all.
hi
We must have different sterns.
about that.
He said to fix it and get the guy working
as for the cyber bro i'll decide who gets what and who doesn't, it's certainly not up to you
it's not up to you to decide that, especially since stern isn't a stern anymore)
i don't have a personal problem with you guys
I don't think it's your business, but it's not on behalf of the conti and the trike team in general, we have no cheats and will not have any, the boss made it very clear to everyone that you are cheating.
Hey, what's up?
What do you mean, taken away, arrested?
if so, we need to think and clearly understand how they found our servers
They find them sooner or later.
It's okay.
I bought us. I'm on my way over.
I'm going to download everything on it.
♪ everything I download ♪
locally to myself the whole date will be downloaded
Ok. So 100% we can't get the servers back.
you don't know if they have logs on them?
not 100%
I don't have the info from DTs yet.
and the logs were kept there?
support for such a long time has not yet responded?
It's strange.
Bro
I don't know.
DTs are silent
got it
I'm pinging the servers.
I think they're available.
ping
yeah, they're not alive
amerikas, it's them bitches for sure
It's not a fact.
I don't believe in coincidences in my life.
All right, as long as time permits a couple of days to 30 with the americans.
let them suffer.
[21:29:46] <balzak> it all worked
it all worked
so, we fucked up 4 companies, and only 2 came to the panel, somewhere else 2 hung and the most interesting hung, financiers
So what shall we do with americas? shall we choke them with a farce as it turns out or wait for a response from the dc?
i don't know what to do with them but i think they're the reason we fucked up the servers
make a helpdesk that only adds builds
tramp didn't write you anything?
what to do with americos?
Done

as it was before.
All done. I'll change your builds tomorrow afternoon.
All done tomorrow I will replace your builds in the afternoon
hi
Hi
what are we going to do about americas?
Hi
Write them that we've given you enough dates.
I have a little idea.
Go to
write them like all your date 650GB is in the archives, broken into parts. it takes a long time to get your files out. and then add that we have already given enough dates and so tomorrow we will start posting if you do not pay. They say they do not pay, then I download the film at 20-30 gigs and archive by dividing into parts and fill a few parts with the publication))) even if they want to watch them fuckin' will not work. so resonance will go and fuckin' clear will not be there date or not. I think they do not want to risk and will pay. But it will only be on one condition, that they do not know for sure that our servers were stolen
That way we'll know if it's because of them or not.
What do you think?
I can't think of anything cleverer
but just to choke them like they have already given a lot and will not give them 4 more files, well, it's ridiculous in my opinion
Yes, we can try it
Let's see how they react
Ok
Then I'll write them today and see what happens.
Go to
Done

Have you thought about the maritime investments, how much are we going to put up?
I made a blog about it.
You can send the first message to them.
Uncle, let me know when you're in touch.
I'm not sure how much we're gonna charge for the maritime investment?
I blogged about it.

Just a link.
and a description of what we have.

hi)
now here and at work
there were things to do in the offe, and here i've been sorting them out
you have a backup of the latest new companies all have? can make a file tree for each company and me to send? something I do not know how to do it in the mega.
yes there is
But I don't know how to make a tree file with nasa
I sent screenshots to someone yesterday.
we are the same linux
screenshots - very bad that you sent so
The mega will know right away and will be looking for it.
so it is better to make a text file like we did
screenshots - too bad you did that
You think I didn't think of that? )
I didn't make mega screenshots.
I went to us on ftp
and took screenshots from ftp
so it's better to make text files like we did
Yeah sure I understand, I'll figure it out soon

Maybe I'll put a domain on us.
It's either a tree that works
or the tree.
losst
you can go there through the intranet anyway it is behind three vpns
I don't remember.
ok
[16:12:42] <tramp> screenshots - too bad you did that
you think i didn't think about it ? )  - i didn't doubt you thought about it))
by the way, did you ever wonder why they found the file servers? how did they leak the ip address?
Hey, .
Where did your assistant go?
I see he's deleted from my contacts.
What's going on with the crypto?
I'm out of town on business as usual. I'll be there soon.
.
By the way, do you have any idea why they found the file servers? How did they leak the IP address?
All they saw was the routing.
and then it could be anything.
They weren't under our control.
I can see that.
But not to the end.

how ?

what about the crypts?

They got a date and they're fucked.

Can you check with your lawyer about how much you're talking about?
I'm not writing.
what amount.
I want to know.
You need a lawyer here.
They're fucking around.
What problems with the law do they have?
Is that right?
Their problems start when they give money to terrorists.
never mind
ok
4.5k or 4.5k
I don't think so
Then you should write that we know your laws very well
and don't give a fuck
and you'll get your proof
when we post your date)
you can download it from our website
or what's your idea?
I'll show you.
We're talking to a lawyer.
doomsday!
Hey!
We came to an agreement before the New Year.
You got a lot of time, more than enough to find any sum and fulfill your part of this agreement.
However, you now ask for additional time, additional proofs etc. Seems like you are preparing to break the agreement and flee or just to decrease the sum.

Moreover, it is a very strange request and its explanation. A lot of companies pay such amounts without any problems.

So, our answer:
We are waiting for the abovementioned sum until February 5. We hold our words. If we see no payment and you continue to add any conditions, we begin to upload data.
That is all.

Taiwan-based electronics company Delta Electronics, a contractor for Apple, Tesla, HP and Dell, was the victim of a cyber-attack using ransomware.
Delta Electronics is the world's largest supplier of switching power supplies, with sales of more than $9 billion last year.
Although Delta Electronics' notice does not say who is behind the attack, an unnamed IS company found a sample of the Conti ransomware on the contractor's network. According to The Record, Conti operators encrypted 1,500 servers and 12,000 computers out of about 65,000 devices on Delta Electronics' network.
The extortionist group demanded a $15 million ransom for the decryptor and to prevent leaks of stolen data. The cybercriminals promised a discount if the company "settled" quickly.

Hey
I didn't have time to finish yesterday, I'll finish it today.
on the admin panel I have a couple of questions)
1. Is it possible in the admin panel to make a separate search field for "sys" ?
for example, sometimes there are sessions in one network (domain) at once 5-10, and I would like to select all of them at once
and the search would be useful, so that I enter in the field, for example, "bigcompany.local" and search for sys info
and wherever this line appears, I'll get a session

His toad.
I had a couple of questions.)
hors@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion
That's the only one I know.
Is he online right now?
Hi)
can you give me a contact for chors please
it's a weird situation here, he's overloading the networks the doomsday team works with
status unavailable
ok, please ask him to add me
Maybe he'll write you back.
Yeah I will
it's a weird situation here that he is overloading nets that are already signed and working with the doomsday team
hmmm... got it
it's not nice to do that somehow)
still yesterday signed a grid, working with it
today in the admin panel saw - he loads it
or you can give it to him, I'll tell him the name of the grid
because the grid is signed, in the work already, but in the admin today saw that it overloads himself)
It's not pretty.
Do you have a contact dyl?
Maybe he is overloading it, maybe I am wrong to blame chors
I just want to find out who is doing it.
No. .
dylon@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion has one of these.
Or dyl does it, I don't know.
I dont know if it is dyl or not but i wish i could get the message to both of them that it is wrong and tell them who is working with the grid before they do it.
thanks

HOSIT is not as important as the date as it is the decript.
cause it's european.
They don't give a fuck about the date.
it's the other way around in the south.
Europeans need to get everything up and running so it works.

It's very badly hit.

Okay, as long as it's affordable. I'm in. Thanks.
Are you gonna give them the amount now?
No. .

Hi!
I thought I'd never see you again. Something seems to be going wrong.
Colleagues are posting links to articles about your correspondence.
It seems to be about the old stuff, but you've disappeared, no paycheck.
I thought I had to look for a job. It happens all kinds of things.
However, I did it according to my own plan. I'll write more later.
You worked hard?)))
Hey, no, we're good.
Hey, .

You wouldn't believe it if I did. Let's get ready to work.
Okay, there's Veron waiting for the paperwork.

1. More about other blockchains, studied Byteball.
At first I was interested in it. But then it turned out that
Their blockchain (on DAG) is held by witnesses, which are
Google and others. Twelve witnesses. There will be no witnesses,
there will be no blockchain. I found a video of a lecture by one of the developers of
Byteball. He was very unconvincing about the case. The audience, too.
was, in my opinion, disappointed. Witnesses have to constantly add
their transactions to the DAG. Thereby witnessing to the past. If you later add
transaction with re-spend and parents from the past, there will be no
witnesses and it will be worthless. The blockchain is written entirely in js. The database is on mysql.
To deploy a full client, you have to rent a server, install everything on it,
Get a certificate for SSL. Network communication is over https.
Although I had the idea of running the client through an anonymously obtained server.
I've been thinking about that.
 
2. Since I still haven't decided which blockchain principle to stick with, I started looking at
polkadot. This blockchain is written in Rust. The language is new. I'm actually quite conservative in programming languages.
I'm a conservative, I stuck to C++, and I still do. But I need to understand blockchain, so I
so I downloaded the Rust tutorial, installed the compiler, and have been studying it for three days. The claim is,
that Rust is very suitable for blockchain development. We'll see. If it's really true,
and this language improves programmer productivity, then why not.

3. NFT also popped up. We'll have to take a look.

4. What I have determined for myself.
Blockchain should be done on DAG. The unit of record in DAG will not be a block with a bunch of transactions,
but a single transaction. A transaction can contain any entity: a coin transfer,
a smart contract, a token of some kind (NFT). As a database mysql, probably. Until I solve the issue
with double spending, witnesses. Witnesses can be the developers (us), in principle.
In the first phase without sharding, I think we will do. For now it's like this.

Hi!

Let's discuss.

1. No matter how much I read about blockchain vs. DAG, all the authors think that the future is in DAG after all. Let's take it for now.

2. whatever we dream of, the known layers in this system are clearly distinguishable:
- A P2P network that connects nodes;
- a distributed database (DAG or blockchain) that stores some kind of blocks and ensures that customers trust what it stores;
- what is the payload in the blocks - transactions or whatever, even pictures, or DeFi.
And these layers are independent, provide interfaces to each other and that's it (like a networking stack, for example).

3. Our clients will run the nodes on anonymously rented servers. Not on home computers, right?

Near is attractive because the documentation is friendly.
Like, we will teach you how it works and how you can use it, even if you are not well prepared.
My understanding is that you can use their P2P and blockchain (they have blockchain), and you can add your own payload.
They do have smart contracts, though.

All right, well, that settles it.
Let me know when you do.
I fucked up your cat.
Hi!

Let's discuss.

1. No matter how much I read about blockchain vs. DAG, all the authors think that the future is in DAG after all. Let's take it for now.

2. whatever we dream of, the known layers in this system are clearly distinguishable:
- A P2P network that connects nodes;
- a distributed database (DAG or blockchain) that stores some kind of blocks and ensures that customers trust what it stores;
- what is the payload in the blocks - transactions or whatever, even pictures, or DeFi.
And these layers are independent, provide interfaces to each other and that's it (like a networking stack, for example).

3. Our clients will run the nodes on anonymously rented servers. Not on home computers, right?
Another day went by...
I started to study Near.
Anyway, time goes by and so far there is no use...

Near is attractive because the documentation is friendly.
Like, we will teach you how it works and how you can use it, even if you are not well prepared.
My understanding is that you can use their P2P and blockchain (they have blockchain), and you can add your own payload.
They do have smart contracts, though.
It is written in Rust.
But only under Linux.
I'm here

3. Our clients will run the nodes on anonymously rented servers. Not on home computers, right?

That's right, not even clients, but validators.
I understand that you can use their P2P and blockchain (they have blockchain), and you can add your own load.
Although they also have smart contracts.


Yes
But we have to do something of our own
to have smart contracts of course)

Hi!
1. I took a look at monero.
Yeah, it's the only blockchain that cares a lot about anonymity.
It's explicitly stated in their docs. The principle is clear, that's about what I imagined.
It's written in C++, works only on linux, of course.

2. There is also Exonum. This is an open source framework for
blockchain-based applications.
It is oriented to work with closed blockchains.
The Exonum framework was created specifically for developing private blockchains.
It is a system where only a
a predefined group of nodes (the same validators).
This one is written in Rust. I took a look at their Github. You can see that they maintain,
there were some changes a month ago. Not abandoned.


I have to do something already. I feel like a slacker. Reading, reading...
Anyway, I'm trying to make a p2p network in Rust. I'm getting to grips with it and have already started writing code.
But Exonum is something I have to check out.

I'm away. I'll be back later.
hello
Please make a build pin

Hi!
Yesterday, Friday, waited for you late. )))
Today is Saturday. Here's the deal.
I had a closer look at Exonum.
Decided to give it a try. The bottom line is that it's just a blueprint
for the blockchain. You can write everything yourself.
And the structure of transactions and contracts.
The framework itself is written in Rust.
We write all our own stuff in Rust too.
The contracts, too, in Rust.
I'm not an expert in Rust yet, but despite my conservatism
in programming languages (I use nothing but C++), Rust
suddenly appealed to me. I'm already about a third of the way through the 600+ page tutorial.
Indeed, Rust is faster to develop than C++.
In general, if you believe the Exonum developers, you can pretty quickly roll up your
private blockchain. Their last edits to the git were on January 13, so they're accompanying it.
If you don't mind, I'll look into it next week, then I'll report back.
Give me your backup contact.
Don't knock the price tag so drastically.
From $2,000 to $100,000.
That's not normal.
You know they're bullshitting.
We've had situations where they told us they could pay 100k at the most.
We ended up paying 5k.

It is oriented to work with closed blockchains.
The Exonum framework was created specifically for developing private blockchains.
It is a system where only a
a predefined group of nodes (the same validators).
This one is written in Rust. I took a look at their Github. You can see that they maintain,
there were some changes a month ago. Not abandoned.


I have to do something already. I feel like a slacker. Reading, reading...
Anyway, I'm trying to make a p2p network in Rust. I'm getting to grips with it and have already started writing code.
But I have to take a closer look at Exonum.

Hi!
Yesterday, Friday, waited for you late. )))
Today is Saturday. Here's the deal.
I had a closer look at Exonum.
Decided to give it a try. The bottom line is that it's just a blueprint
for the blockchain. You can write everything yourself.
And the structure of transactions and contracts.
The framework itself is written in Rust.
We write all our own stuff in Rust too.
The contracts, too, in Rust.
I'm not an expert in Rust yet, but despite my conservatism
in programming languages (I use nothing but C++), Rust
suddenly appealed to me. I'm already about a third of the way through the 600+ page tutorial.
Indeed, Rust is faster to develop than C++.
In general, if you believe the Exonum developers, you can pretty quickly roll up your
private blockchain. Their last edits to the git were on January 13, so they're accompanying it.
If you don't mind, I'll look into it next week, then I'll report back.
Hi, what kind of news is this?
yeah
I'm here.
I read your reports. It's okay.
I don't have anything to say to you yet.
It's like you and I haven't really figured out
what we need.
It's cool that you like Rust.
I think he can help us out with the smart contracts.
I have an account there.
but I can't get in.
I'll be there this afternoon.

We are very upset that you don't believe in the fulfillment of our conditions. First of all, we appreciate and value our reputation (about us and on the fulfillment of our agreements you can find a lot of information in the Internet). This is the main thing. But you will understand this when we make the deal. The second one, we will explain you a little bit deeper about amount: The Conti has a big legal department and it checks all the possible data and sources to establish an appropriate amount. We check your annual income, the value of materials (you have a lot of SENSETIVE and PRIVATE files, Military bufget and so on), etc. Also, please don't forget about the decryption software and our expenses. Therefore, basing on all the info, we set a 5% amount for a payment. FYI, every our client is asked to pay this sum, you are not unique. But considering your situation we can give you very big disount - 20%. Now our price for you is $8kk.
I already fuckin' told them that.
Maybe add the second...
...so they know why it's so expensive and remind them about the date, it's a big fucking deal.
