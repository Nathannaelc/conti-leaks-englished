[21:04:38] <hof> well, it's not always a hanyou
[21:05:12] <hof> sometimes some kind of antivirus does not allow to run modules
[21:05:22] <hof> bot passes devhash
[21:05:42] <hof> it's connected to the hardware of the computer/virtual
[21:06:18] <hof> I think it is one of the most important parameters
[21:06:26] *** hof now Available [50]
[21:07:13] <dgh> In other words we'd better make a devhash in addition to the domain to be sure that there is already the same bot?
[21:07:47] <hof> usually normal bots have original devhash
[21:08:49] <hof> let's say there were 2-3 bots with the same devhash if let's say the bot died on the machine, then started again, but not 60-70
[Error: message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
I think we add devhash after the domain.

hi
crunchbase

You got it?
Give me access to it.
We're up and running on Mon.
Operators only warmed up 200 contacts on the sites.
it's not enough.
They're going up
By Friday, they'll be up to 500-800.
By Friday, they'll all be coordinated.
They need to get into work mode

[03:42:31] <blood> working on Mon
[03:42:40] <blood> operators warmed up only 200 contacts by objects
[03:42:42] <blood> not enough
[03:42:44] <blood> are breaking up
[03:42:52] <blood> on Friday they will bring it to 500-800
[03:42:58] <blood> on friday all will agree
[03:43:03] <blood> they need to get into work mode
hello
okay)
just in time to test everything again)\
hahaha))))
not bored there?))
testing
tell Horse
about Mon.
work
tell him to get ready.
no))
although I want to see it in battle
honestly)
Don't worry.
The americans will have time
all this will be over
and there's a question)
a week's worth of work.
we'll see how it's covered)
and fix it all
or smear it)))
they all covered).
i don't believe that they won't cover it in a month
yes they will cover it, of course
the question is how much time it will take)
with the host
I'm asking you to decide
I'm convinced that on the first day
we're gonna run into
with locks on the blacklist.
domain
If it's gone, it's not in the trust.
100%
Okay, I'll look into it this weekend.
What are the options?
Thanks
Well, maybe that's an option.
will solve a lot of
problems
potential
And to be fair.
it's been a long time since anyone fucked an american.
on Twitter about the body attacks
There hasn't been a mention in a long time
anywhere
It's gonna be effective now.
in the next two weeks.
very
and then the briefings again
briefings
staff training
brainwashing
constant rants to everyone inside the company
that there are attacks, don't talk to anyone.
global paranoia.
and you wouldn't want
to smear everything
like, let's do a week's worth of setup
lend
but to have at hand
working version
i'm sure of the opreators.
they were making thousands of loadas targeting 50 ml of revue at the time
before they went on vacation, they made thousands.
♪ and they'll do it now ♪
just to get into the rhythm.
there is room for improvement, but we'll do a test this way, if it goes - already think about how to improve and fuck even more)
ok
♪ if on Mon ♪
they'll be done in an hour
3 landlords
they're all on different domains right?
And hosts.
I don't think they will.
Yeah, on different domains.
But just in case, I'll figure out how to do it over the weekend.
Do you know how much they charge?
And a zero suction.

You want me to tell you?
Three minutes.
Boosa will tell you.
Fucking cloud.
so why else would we be using the bazaar?)
you know what? It's up to you.
why you can't have another bazaar))
i'm not just asking.
))
another one was written.
I understand. I'll take a look this weekend.
10 of them.
What do you want it for?)
spam.
Lives knocking.
Trick works okay.
for spam.
just like it's been working.
))
it's worth it to take a week for the operators to work
any software gets stripped down
and it can be thrown away
to a targeted attack.
you probably haven't seen the time
♪ haven't you seen the time ♪
♪ when it was days ♪
♪ not weeks ♪
weeks to be exact.
in a week
they made the rules.
on certificates
and software
different coders
different coders
different code
methods
only operators worked
in a week or two
could be thrown away
but spammers
have been working for years
but their lojacks
almost shit
why do I have to tell you?
I'm aware of that
if you're interested
like everyone else cares
spam.
Yes, I looked and wondered)
and how much they don't give a crap
for point system attacks
where spam will never make anything go away.
and how...
my word and deed go together?
and conclusions?)
Of course.)
At least that's how it works.
I was told.
bullshit.
it doesn't fucking knock.
30%

by yus.
from spam.
Well, spammers are spammers.
they bring in a penny too
Don't judge them
on the trike is better
You can also attack the coba directly
with it to attack
It'll be better
than on a fancy loafer
tricks' coder is a genius of course)))
but the sessions will fall off
and goodbye bot
there's at least a chance of life to reboot
if something is broken
after a non-stripping action
higher chance
than directly
from a coba
but in essence
the chance from a coba is the same as on a loader ))
for point attacks
with one disadvantage though.
it is higher
session off
and that's it
can't get it back.
really?
why?)))
he wrote a lot of modules for tric
he curates all the new lowers
from dozens of coders
so the bazaar's not that fucked up)
if it's based on what you said)
or it doesn't add up)
I didn't say the bazaar was bullshit.
i understand that it has its own quirks
both the pros and the cons.
trike is a train.
heavy
but it has energy.
and the bazaar
it was purely for the operators
then it was given to the spammers
and it's loaded
heavily
with  modules.
and got a kick in the head
and the base made light versions
coders
they were all killed
booza couldn't take it
and said he wanted to do something else
because everything is too nervous)
tired of the constant destruction)))
that all their creations
ruined).
oh yeah, it's demotivating)
fucked up when the wall you spent a week building is broken down in a couple of hours)
it was a breakdown in the end))
)))
what's he getting paid for?))
and all the people
he has spammers
as an outlet))
like let me work with them)
i said fuck it
and i gave him a break.
i asked him how you were.
He says he's resting.

I need either you or Ali to contact hash, c buza or Stern and agree on the use of spambot.
I then please let me know which bot will work with spambot. As I understand it, the problem is that the size of the botnet has decreased... Y that's why I ask what bot will work)".

hi there?
his big day has arrived. 24 hours remaining until the biggest pump signal of all time! The target this time will be around 400% gains possibly even more. We will be targeting $100 million volume. With the bull market being in full effect and volumes being high, the odds of reaching 400% profit will be very high once again. We will do everything in our power to make sure we reach this target, if you have missed our previous big successful pumps, this is also the one you will not want to miss.  A massive pump is about to begin in only 24 hours, be prepared.

A massive pump is about to begin in only 24 hours, be prepared.
API is done, I'll come closer to the pump at about 18
API's done, I'll come back closer to pamp at 18

Hi bro, i will be in touch tomorrow
hi
gotovo
Man, the bullshit started that some of the guys are freezing the money and locking the account. Two people so far unsubscribed, I think not the last ...
One had to refund, exchanger locked and froze the money for 3 months, asking for a bunch of documents and an explanation of where the bits came from.
Burana has 4 people so far, + 4 new axintendents at us and 2 coders.
I had almost all of them that I could catch online, tomorrow I will finish all the loose ends and change purses and systems probably just in case
There we are again in the news on securitilab...

[Error: Message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
which address is the error?
I put the upload on a new one.
I think it'll fill up in the morning.
Then I'll put everything in.
hey bro, i'll be in touch tomorrow and i'll tell you all about it
although no, the server was crooked raid, i put it re-create, there nve 4 disks on 3841GB i re-create them in 10 raid, so the total storage was almost 8tb ... that is 3841GB and 3841GB + 3841GB and 3841GB

and there was essentially nothing, I accidentally noticed when I downloaded to one of these drives that there are 3 more
creation will roughly take 9-10 hours, in the morning put the fill, I changed the pads, there will be more speed to fill, for 4-5 hours I think it should manage

how they managed to exactly at 17-00 (UTZ) in the 9 bits (raised the price from 8 + to 11)
?
working on it
throw in
the second one will also have to reimburse (brooks in rocket) not give him the dough
hey bro
 <johnyboy77> i was thinking of banning faer from the host machine altogether. allow only the first virtual machine. it will connect to the VPN and share the internet with the virtual machine which will raise the torus. and the last virtual machine will share it with the working virtual machines

The only thing if you really bother, you need to host a usb modem and a separate VPN, and on the virtual machines the same, you wired everything and from the virtual machine where you will distribute the Internet - another VPN, so they do not intersect
hi bro, yes, here :)
[09:05:32] <mango> hello let's but under your responsibility
if it doesn't work - you'll reimburse me)))
hi bro, yes, here :)
this needs to be done by all, otherwise toad will stop working for you

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know if it's OK.

my analysis of the ToR
Yahoo/AOL.
===
gmail was kicked out, right?
this is the most interesting material, it is the basis of all development

Mail names are generated based on macros
===
I have a much cooler design

3. captcha is not yet taken into account, we'll take it into account

4. proxy is a weak option, there will be nordvpn or amazon lambdas (as in the cart) in the docker

5. SMTP will take into account

6. create a profile

7. Mailing is done via GET requests for fast mailing of large volumes of 100,000,000, 200,000,000 letters.
===
This is a childish variant - any mail server will kill such activity immediately. This article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ describes a working variant - it will be necessary to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account, sent by an AI emulator with mouse movements simulating human ones. Every mailer now has an AI, it recognizes all the movements in the browser, and their AI will just laugh out loud at the get requests to send hundreds of thousands of emails.

8. the point with the authorization by cookie without a password - correct, I noticed it a long time ago when working with stylers, you load a cookie and just log in to the account

9. We put in 1000 accounts and 100 proxies, and these all 1000 accounts are assigned randomly to these 100 proxies with repetition, if there are more proxies, then 1 acre 1 proxy.
===
When you change ip in the ak will immediately begin problems with login, it is better to abandon this option, the ideal option - docker with VPN.

10. Generating PDF files with macros + with wkhtmltopdf
===
you do not need to do this, the folder can do it from birth

Everything else seems to be fine.

2) Does anyone know about this in detail?

3) Study these above system, code, working principles. To build our own, where it will be already possible to stick NFT, DEFI, DEX and all the new trends that are and will be. So, other already created their own coins, exchanges and projects on our system.
Tell us how you do, what success, maybe there are some ideas?

hi
I'm hovering now, I'm interested in trading, defi, blockchain, new projects... There's a return on investment everywhere. And it's kind of boring with everything. I'm sure you'll get your own thing going there too. There's probably a big dream in this thread, not sure if it's necessary but it will be useful for everyone. too many secrets big companies hold on to, thinking it's their main value, these patents and data.

Hi, again, it's up to the 13th. It seemed to us in the morning that we were followed, as in the yard were unfamiliar cars, in the car sit two bodies. So as not to set anyone up, not you and not us. I and Dorirus decided to go into seclusion for a week, all the devices are temporarily in the headquarters apartment. We'll be gone for about a week. It's better to be reassured because our case is extended until November 13. By November 13, everything will be solved, we hope that the case will be dropped. Since it is essentially already impossible to get anything from us. The only thing that bothers me is that the Canadians have a request for 4 Russians. I hope we are not on the list.)
And the lawyers say that until the 13th it is better to sit quietly and do nothing. Live a normal life. And then we'll see what happens.
I warned the guys I work with that I wouldn't be there.

Tell me how you're doing, what progress, maybe have some ideas?
THIS MUST BE DONE AT ALL, otherwise your toad will stop working for you

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know it's OK.

are you there ?
I did not mean to step on your toes seems I did not get my message over to you. We do understand the consequences of the situation. That is why we want to negotiate a solution with you! All I was trying to deliver is the message that we are in a tough economic situation and simply cannot pay your demand. I have spoken to my management. They understand the situation and are willing to pay. The money we can afford is 500,000.00 USD. This is a huge amount for us. Please let us fix a deal.
These are the guys you wrote the letter to yesterday
their price to unlock is $2,000,000.
We need to get them up to 1.5k at least.
social networking bro not ready to translate?

Hi. .
We've written almost everything here.
How are you?


Can I congratulate you?)
no
Congratulations on what?
Well, if only on the beginning)
well, with the success-payment)
а)
It hasn't been paid yet.
.
They offered us 500,000.
We said no, don't make us laugh with kopecks.
I think we can get it down to 800-1,000.
no more
Well, look at it.
How?)
I think we can get up to 1.5k.
It would be cool
They're really pissed about their date
it's not important to them XD
))
well allegedly yes
))
hello
ahah
let's see)
Yeah.
i'm having a really fucking busy weekend
no rest for a minute.
one minute blogging, the next minute replying.
blogging, blogging, answering.
And motivation is good.
Well, as I understand it, I'm not on the percentage yet.
and will be the salary, and then as the payments will be transferred to the percentage
I don't even know how much the salary is here, they didn't tell me at all
I don't get paid at all at Manco's.)
so i don't know bro, we'll see in a week
just a percentage.
well you have there every week rushes so maybe not enough disk space to store bits)

yeah no

hi. Everything is super good. But watching today. Get your champion friend up and running again.
I have a lot of analytical work to build in.
Made a computing center to set up the whole scheme. That is to say, pushing forward on the immediate areas.
Networked 1 gigabit, put in 2 TB SSDs. Tied the LAN into the home network for automatic transfer of the development to the industrial server.
With this configuration we will quickly see the results. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough energy to write simple routine requests for placing limit or market orders.
But I have worked out a question about retailing stop, when the stoploss will follow the price upwards and fix only the final short of the pound.
This will allow us to raise the percentage much more.
[09:05:32] <mango> hi come on but under your responsibility
if it does not work - you pay me back)))
ok, ready to take the risk )
it is very tasty yum-yum )
but in principle it should be Ok.

hello - we are going through the process of the committees required to make a decision in this case. as you know we are a government public transport agency and there is not a single person who can make a decision here. can you allow us a couple of extra days beyond the original 6 days you mention? also is there any more discount you can offer on the price because it changes how many decision makers need to approve.
What do they need to put together?
Let me know when you do. I'll explain it to you again.
this needs to be done by everyone or else your toad won't work for you anymore.

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know if it's OK.
Hey bro.
Rocket crashed, looks like the server.

I think 1 more extra day will be enough. We think you are a people in a stressful situation, not a turtle.
We are ready to give you a small discount, if you'll be conscious in your behavior. Small discount - don't wait for a serious price reduction.

Hi
Hi
Hi, listen Hof is not interested at all, we need to put someone in his place, tomorrow decide who can replace him, preferably an old one, and replace him with a new one, I mean what Hof did the new one shouldn't do
He will be able to get the detects to work and he will have to do it on his own.
Hi
I've been talking to rocco about the steps of the detec.
We need to move faster to routers.
We found some good dealers who give us clean Ip's.
the only thing you need to do is transfer ipi on both sides of the bot and backend in a get request instead of in the handler, like in tr
otherwise everything will work at once
maybe tomorrow you will also give the coders a hard time
right now the end vpbs are knocking on the intermediate vpbs that dives into the torus to the north
That's the weakest link
it's glowing hard, it's not likely to happen through the rotuers
the script will autoroboot the torus on the intermediate
Hi

We're discussing with rocco the steps of the detec.

This needs to be done by everyone, or the toad won't work for you anymore.

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know it's OK.

need to establish who it is, i think - it's a bank, i hope my complaint worked!!!
:yes::yes::yes:
yes
now
came out
see
it's working
There was some fucked up connection.
everything's back on now and it's working
blocking
Oh, great.
It's more reliable.
I'll get Skippy on the computer and help him set it up.
Why did he need my account?
Hey, .
Can't you do more of that?
You don't have to make a house.
Why would he have one?
Let him have it too.
ok
chats see
ok
Yeah.
Did you read my answer?
i am so fucking tired of copy-pasting.
We took down a big company this morning.
we got two australias coming up.
and a big europa at night.
Cool. .
♪ throw it to me right away ♪
I'll prepare the blogs
I think it's too early
We'll wait a couple of days.
Ok, whatever you say.
soon I'll give a shop that I never wrote
his part of the data will be published
Okay
Let me write them a letter, too.
with a link to the blog
and the data leak)
It worked great with the bank.
KISTERS AG is going to be hard to bend.
You need a lawyer to read it.
They have this paper on each person's date:
Consent to Publication of Personal Data and Pictures
[Error: Message encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Tell Skippy
He's got a lawyer reading it.
Yeah, I saved it.
I'll send it to him.
It's very ambiguous. If he's not a lawyer, we could be fucked by them.
Yeah. .
agree
I quit paying attention to that kind of thing.
cause if we get a really good lawyer there, we're gonna get screwed.
and skippy writing won't help us
I'm not even talking about mine.)

Hi
crypto?
Sure.
Yes
But there are nuances.
Does anyone on our team do decryption?
That's not what I mean.
What needs to be decrypted?
pdf file
on the password.
Someone's brute-forcing our hashes.
Maybe he'll put a file in it, too.
Let me ask the hash guy.
Go to .
Hi.

Hi
I replied)
any old passwords to the pdf?
No, bro, I don't. If I did, I would've dropped a list in the archive.
Okay.
Don't let him waste his resources.
It's not that important.
I'll check the chat room.
Okay. .
Are you free already?

Are you free yet?
Yeah. .
I'll be gone in an hour or so. I'll change my location.
WARNING. I don't want it to be like yesterday.
Everything okay?

[16:39:57] <bio> no bro, no. if it was I would have given it to you as a list in the archive
ok
I'm gonna go with skippy on the letter to hermer
he's not gonna write.
i suggest you write it like i told you yesterday
Why wouldn't he write it?
We've made all the recommendations to protect him, but there's always a weak link in the system - the man.
that's it!!!

What are you looking for?
Give me a link to JAFTEX's website.
Do a blog on it.
I'll do it at .
I thought you published them.
No
I don't know.
I don't have one.
Or maybe I do.
But it's a network.
I need a company or a website.
Have you written to the bank?
Oh, Mr. Hanley, you can believe - we will be online. If you are worried about this, you can leave here your email for us to contact you in case of any force majeure.
I may have done the same.
I don't remember which name
took from the passport posted on the blog
but that's not how I wrote it.
ACNE
you write?
No, no.
that's not me.
it's kippie
he's a fryer.
what the fuck is tramp?
why the smooth transition to the post office?
why the transition?
we're not.
well, that's what i'm thinking. why?
I just don't understand why they want to go to the post office.
That's what I'm saying.
It doesn't seem fair to me.
What do you mean?)
We're not going to take him to the post office.
He's gonna write here.
There's a backup link
We accept payments in BTC. If the amount is too high, you need to know that we offer discounts to clients who pay fast.
Soon you'll receive the message to your mailbox ChrisHanley@solution4u.com.
Man pisses that our site's going down
))
oh well
just like that, you can do anything on the backup link))
you know what I mean
yeah
Well if I were you I would forbid it
because look the situation will be now. you know how many people see this blog. and anyone can write to him and offer him ....))
i would still avoid that in the future
Okay.
I'm looking at the bank, Skippy did it too, I didn't even see it. It was great, no questions asked.
if you have any JAFTEX left please send it to me
I want to know who it is
And while you're at it, how are you tomorrow, weekend?
If you do not mind, I'm tomorrow morning, from 9.30 - 16.00, then off and in the Sun - from 14.30 and up. Would you approve?
Oh, by the way, did you see the lemon transfer there or not?
I'll be here tomorrow.
Come on. Yeah.
♪ do the blogs on the newbies ♪
Yeah, I already did.
almost
Hi.)

Fucking skippy, ACNE.
they decided to pay after all?

I guess so.
apparently it's pretty fucking cool.
oh, that's good.
fuck your count turns out to be
ahah
exactly
well that's the biggest deal i got.
if they pay me.
What do you think about HDP?
how would you respond?
I'll see what the date is.
and I'll let you know.
go ahead)

you go ahead)
and I'll adjust
i'll see
bro, i'm still fucking blogging.
I've got a mountain of information to analyze.
Okay. .
but if you don't analyze the date yet.
It's still the beginning of the phase.
now
ready to read?
++
of course
Do you really think that your information (more than 115 GB) is not worth that much money? Personal data of clients, financial statements of the company and so on are no longer interesting for DarkNet? I think you are wrong. But we can always check it by posting your information on our blog and notifying Internet news agencies. I think the courts and competitors will quickly let you know about yourself.
Well, drink up, please.
or overdrink)
no
I like it.
All right. .
Okay. .
I'll talk to Trump about it.
Go to .

that's not right.
you can't
well, i can't do it any other way
come on
well, i don't know.
he throws me a task at 1:00 in the morning and says I have to do it.
What should I do?)
You gotta do it, bro, or they'll throw me out, and I'll be fucked.
This is the first time I believed that dreams can come true
i told right away that i don't give a fuck working from 3 till midnight)
when I got the job
ahah
they can, bro.
well no one asked me and secondly they said as long as they look at me
you're going to get it...

Well, close it all up there.
Yeah, I'm trying.
Watch this.
A couple of lams on top.

[20:36:25] <bio> also please, while you're here - how are you tomorrow, weekend?

I'm going to make Lam-2 bucks

You're gonna stay here

Yeah, I know.
but hopefully we'll change the condition
later
i'm planning on getting that much too and then i'll probably quit.
i don't need much))
Yeah, that's for sure.
It's just that...
Let me get this straight.
i used to fuck around like this
24 hours a day
I thought about quitting halfway through
now it's a little different, i can quit whenever i want
I just want more money.
I don't think you're gonna quit, bro.
and then it's fucked up, when you're sitting there, the bulb doesn't work.
no fuckin' growth
you'll fuck it up real quick
i'll quit
because I'm scared.
i have two kids
and it's easier for me to have a cushion and a business.
You're not the only one.
than to sit around and take risks.
That's right, bro.
Can't argue with that.
I know opportunity breeds need.
but fuck!
))
don't tell that to tramp.)
or he'll be offended.
his ass is worth more)
he knows.
I agree
I told him.
i've been working with him for a long time as it turns out

before this thread.
well, yeah.
 he did.
except I don't know where he's coming from
and you know what's weird?

i used to write him letters
♪ for 40, 60 bucks a pack ♪
♪ when I wrote him an open toad ♪
I was added to his account.)
and he's the fuck out of where.
Small world.)
it is.
i even have a dareev in my trolley.
All right bro, did you tell tramp I wrote a letter?
we already sent it
Yeah. .
Of course. .
I guess he didn't believe it, huh?

Again, where's the babuk and where are we :)
Yeah.)
the babouk came out on time)
everyone should do it, otherwise the toad will stop working for you.

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do it, let me know if it's OK.

We don't understand each other... You wrote that they need to give the grid to work, he wrote that he even need three) And on what terms, too, I do not understand, gave him your contact here, said he will write you back
[Error: Message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
Yeah.
Well maybe he should get the contact.
On what terms should I give him the triple?
I wrote him that we usually take part of the bots with nets, but what part I do not know))
say 20 percent
let's try there
20% of the bots with nets are ours
ok
I'll be out of here for 20 minutes
Okay. .
20 percent not bots but profits
Let them work it out on their own.
You didn't give him any nets yet?
I gave him a bunch of pulses, he couldn't do anything with them.
I'll try to give him some nets.
I'm sick for a week, then I have to go home...
so I'm not really working...
fuf gj
Yeah, I got it.
Cheer up.
send the btz, I'll get it done soon.

I have a favor to ask of you. I have a problem with my host right now and he can't pay me the check. You can pay for 2 koba: 1 server-101 $ (the second is already paid). 2 pads-$20. 2 domains- 30 euros. This is all from rocco. It's just that he has problems with the system. and I lose time while he solves the problem. Okay?

[22:47:07] <22> for that 500 and this 1000 .... << let's work it out.
right.
Tell me how you're doing, what's the progress, maybe you have some ideas?
THIS MUST BE DONE AT ALL, otherwise your toad will stop working for you.

toad's new domain version 3
odw5mdwotufuxxrgw3pvqjjuze3e33e33bylylkl667h4nefwiimwqsumyd.onion

it is written in the account settings - connection - server
Before that, on this tab, tick the checkbox Manually specify the server address and port

standard port 5222

IMPORTANT, everything else remains, the account is left with the old domain... Only the domain for the connection is prescribed

!!! When you do, let me know it's OK.

already)
Okay. .
I'll translate it and let you know.
Okay.)
Thank you so much.
Check out .

No problem, bro!
It's not showing up yet.
If it's an exchange, it doesn't come right away
Binans, for example, only after the first confirmation
Well usually it's quick
minutes
yes, I know)
5-10
admin doesn't work, nothing to do at all yet
unusual so
Well, yes, on the exchange can not put a fee for the transfer. it itself there exposes.
by the way
found myself a leger
i'll buy it tomorrow
cool)
but the fucking price is three times what it's worth.
which one?
X
okay)
Why is it more expensive?
Bitch local dealers
at dns 15k.
300$
Well, maybe it went up.
That's the price they charged me.
No. .
I looked it up on their website.
And they don't want to haggle at all.
Bro, it's easy, right? I can handle it?
You know what I'm afraid of? That it won't fuck up.
Well, I figured it out on the fly.
Why are you scared?
or else it's the end of the bitcoins.
i don't know what it is yet, i haven't felt it in my hands
I usually use bitcoin core.
it's reliable.
and fast transfers
Anyway, check it out.
and recovery
when you create a cat.
they give you a syd
well, 24 words
you just keep them safe
you can recover if anything on any Ledger
ahhh, is it always given there on the fly?
It's just a key.
Yeah, when you create a wallet.
Like in electrum.
I thought there wasn't a SID.
Oh, I see.
Great.
there is)
Otherwise no one would take them.
and i can restore it on any Ledger?
Yes
well at least on x
i.e. you have to buy another one then)
s probably too.
Well, I only found the X in my place.
I got it, thanks bro. If I get one tomorrow, I'll share my impressions)
Did you get the funds?
Not yet.
I'm just gonna check the blockchain now.
Check .
No, the exchange hasn't given it to me yet.
https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q6gj8ymnjh863gmuvh2nc3462trrvzlxf2atzxn
the exchange is really fucked up
Exmo, man.
but it charged me instantly
No.
they all are.
Are there any confirmations?
Let me see.
It says paid and transaction number.
Nothing else.
transaction number is a hash?
11252367
а

So we wait for the first confirmation.
After that, they usually let her go.
Yeah, I guess so.
Why exmo and not binans?
I honestly don't have much experience
Binance fucks up a lot.
I've never had one.
that's why exmo
Well, maybe it just worked out.
I've been working with them for over a year.
I don't deal with exchanges much.
I usually put bitcoins in there and take usdt out.
well, yes)
Usually 3-5 minutes and the usdt is already with the person
I do it through bestchange
and bitcoin has never withdrawn or transferred at all
Bestchang has a high percentage
they have instant confirmations)
I transferred $1000 and one percent to the guy and he paid me cash.
Yeah, that's great.
Cash is always cash.
Yeah, found one.
Super.)
Said up to 100 grand, no problem.
100k rubles?)
You only need a day's notice
or normal
no dollars
ah, well, that's right
I've got up to 100k wood a day limit on people
but that's a fuckin' lot.
I crossed paths with him three times in person.
I've taken 10k out so far to pay off half the credit
each time in a new car
haha

not
he's fucking crazy.
I got a guy who says you gotta translate it for me in advance.
That's what I do too
and I'll come and give you the money later))
We only worked on the spot the first time
Now I'm transferring so I can just come and get it without waiting.
Yeah, it's my first time too... well, that's fine by the way
They don't have the sense to bail
If they do, I don't know what to do.
I can only ruin my reputation
I have a small village) found out where he lives
if anything, I'll catch him anyway)
ahah
Exactly!)
Reputation means a lot in this business.

Yes
It turns out we only have three of them.
Two guys and a girl.
and everybody knows them.
I'm so fucked up.

Listen, still no transfer from the exchange.
No, nothing yet.
Shit, I wish I could get it transferred by tonight, otherwise you'll be sitting there with no money.
Ask for a hash.
Yes, I think they will.
Well, I've got some.
I don't know how to ask for a hash
I have it in my phone.
30-35к
enough for today
rest)
If he won't transfer it by the evening, we'll think of something else.
Don't worry, bro.
I'll get to a normal kosher.
I'll figure it out if anything
No rush
ok
Yeah, I wanted to help, but like always
Everything's fucked up.
The exchanges are always like this.
no need to worry.
they'll send it, they're just fucking with me.
well that's my inexperience, i don't work with them much

All right, let me know when you get it
so I don't have to worry.
sure
thanks
Well, I check every 20 minutes.
so I'll let you know.
Yeah.
There's no point in doing it more often.
Check it out, bro.
It looks like it's on.)
Yeah.)
well well
a long time, of course, but as well as I could)
Thank you very much.
faster was not in a hurry
Come on, relax.
Thank you

[Error: the message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted.]
Input data:
1. list of validated emails - text file
2. list of address:port SOCKS4/SOCKS5 servers - text file
3. list of test emails - email password - text file
4. list of test message templates - text file
5. test timeout
6. number of test threads

WORKFLOW
7. validate the email (criteria in the appendix)
8. get DNS MX records for domain from email
9. get/generate all possible port/MX/SSL/TLS and other SMTP extensions for security and authentication
10. for each of the options p.9 try to open a connection through a randomly chosen socks-server (p.2) and authorize by the available email and password.
If authorization is successful, send a test letter (item 4) to the test mailbox (item 3).
We put the given tested email and the current time to the pending list (those for which the result is expected).
These checks are performed in several threads, the tested list is divided accordingly.
11. a separate thread checks the test mailboxes (item 3) by the IMAP/POP3 protocol.
From: all incoming emails are compared with the emails from the pending list. If they match, it means the sending through the given account works.
Such email is added to the pending output list.
If there was no incoming mail from the account during the timeout (item 5), such email is entered into the timeout list.
In all other cases the email is marked as unusable.

REQUIREMENTS
12. Working under Linux operating system.
13. Implementation language - preferably Python, other options are discussed.
14. The general aspiration of the checker should be to reduce scanning time. As many scans per unit time as possible - taking into account multithreading or whatever.

hi
payment came.
the whole thing?
I only saw part of it.
750
Well, we're waiting for the second part.
250 ?
Yeah.
okay
So far, the bitches aren't talking.
I texted them at 4:00 a.m.
and they still don't say anything.
Look at what the bank threw out
give me your opinion please
Yeah, I saw it.
It's okay.
It's fine.
They don't want to pay much but they have to.
It's just beautiful to understand them.
increase your offer 5 times
everything
yes the bank will give 3-4k
I think so too
next time say 50% off
of the total amount
And that's the edge
edge
Considering that you don't need a cryptor
no you just need to write for example the price for you 3700% is 50% more of the price but this is the extreme price if you want to negotiate pay
I don't get it))
but okay.
Oh, shit!
busy
you can write later if you want to hear our extreme offer is 3700
Trampych, today at about 17.15 I'll leave and be there tonight, around 21.00
We can't go any lower than that unless we go public.
Skippy'll cover for me.
Okay. .
Okay. .
Yeah, got it.
But I'm thinking no lower than 4k.
You can do 4k.
write
Even better
Okay.
they will raise the price later
and we'll meet somewhere around 3.5
Maybe.
you have experience you know better
Eh, I was betting on them to pay more than 5k.)
Who's the one who's supposed to be on the phone today?
deciding to fix his software
tomorrow he'll give us new builds and we'll start targeting again
yes they should
there will be a new arrival
I need you to give me some pointers on SYR
so far their software is screwed up (
and gypsies
soon have to tell the terms and conditions
so I'll be ready
SYR - 255srv | 6VCentr/49EsxI |46M + 43M (dnb) - 121M (zoom) |
gypsies is tko ?
Huu...
Hungarians
short
so how much SYR did you put out originally, don't you remember?
SYR - did they get 2500 or 3000?
HOULEELEC - gypsies?
yes

You don't remember how much we charged the SIRCHIE
no
can you rhubarb them?

I can

Nah, everything is 45million.
45M dnb.
how much is that?
what is dnb
bro, let's answer the bank
already answered)
ku
cool
dnb don't know what it is
maybe it's just a reference to the source of the rhubarb data, dnb.no
Could be.
So 45M.
here?
Uh-huh. .
But it's not that kind of data.
I think to take 3% and the amount will be for them.
yeah

I think it's working through torus.

ok I will, after the laying only

the original variant has disappeared?

No, why?
There's a bug in the code somewhere, I'm looking for it.


Let me check my place.
Did you make the key?
all done
SSH_KEY="/var/www/.ssh/ip_rules_id_rsa"
It connects and overwrites the file.
Okay.
Frontends.txt file should contain only ipi and port
no comments or anything.
[Error: Message encrypted and can't be decrypted.]
there just might be more than one, that's why they did it that way.


I'll check and report back.
