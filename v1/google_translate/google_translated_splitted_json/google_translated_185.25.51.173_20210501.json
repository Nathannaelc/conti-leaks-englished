Salamander wrote everything off, I&#39;m waiting for reports from him. 2. Signed off with Veron - he has troubles with the dock so far. I promised to help him over the holidays, either we’ll make a dock for him, or the second option is a container. I gave him a presentation, described everything how it works and what he can do, I’m waiting to see how. At the start, he will say during the holidays - he is waiting for the issue with the dock / delivery of the payload to be resolved. 3. You still haven&#39;t answered what config is needed for installs. Let me remind you that we decided to give the version of Trick2 for it (which was originally planned for Target) for Veron - which modules should be in the troy config, and which ones can be removed so as not to fire extra modules and reduce the weight / detections of exe. If I understand the software device correctly, I need an injector, pvgrab, importdll. What other modules are vital in the config? 4. Contacted Hors about admins - he clarified the task, He says we need pentesters rather than admins. And at 6 in the morning, a great idea came to my beautiful and drunk head where to get them :) Do you remember the revils were promoted for damage - they threw lam bucks in cue balls on a deposit and then they started to break the topic - they wrote there that they were inviting teams of hackers / pentesters to work with them. They wrote 5 pages of the topic with suggestions! They write something like that. &quot;Team 3 people experience, etc&quot; and there are a lot of them 5 or more even pages! That&#39;s where we&#39;ll take them! I will spam personals with a job offer for them all + many people left contacts there themselves (although everyone has toxins). By the 10th it will be done. The only question is how to pay them. How much do we pay? 2k - how is everyone? And the salary for me if possible)) bc1qclzlkq8j3ckmulye0k5xpzfymsxxha735mlauf"}, {"ts": "2021-05-01T12:19:04.027988", "to": "stern@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion", "from": "mango@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion", "body": "And here&#39;s another. I suggest for Verona to always prepare 2 files at once for 2 groups. So that in case the file gets tired quickly (and this is not uncommon for us + its volumes) - we always had a ready-made encrypted second file in order to avoid downtime and waiting for cryptors. I think it will be a good move, I just remember the times when I myself lil - our main problem was to get the file by 10 am (and he is an early bird and does not tolerate delay) and the second moment is the replacement of crypts - before it could last for 2 hours.
