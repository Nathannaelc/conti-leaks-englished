Looked at monero. Yes, it is the only blockchain that cares a lot about anonymity. They say it right in the docs. The principle is clear, I approximately and represented. Written in C++, works only under linux, of course. 2. There is also Exonum. It is an open source framework for building blockchain applications. It is focused on working with private blockchains. The Exonum framework was created specifically for the development of private blockchains. This is a system in which only a predefined group of nodes (those same validators) can create new blocks in the blockchain. This one is written in Rust. I looked at their Github. It can be seen that they are accompanying, a month ago there were some changes. Not abandoned. We must already do something. I see myself as a bum. Reading, reading... In general, I&#39;m trying to make a p2p network in Rust. I understand and have already started writing code.
